150th Anniversary of Gomidas’ Birth Celebrated with Lebanon Concert
On June 30, 2019, an Armenian and non-Armenian public in Lebanon was invited to respect and immortalize the memory of the renowned Gomidas Vartabed on the sesquicentennial of his birth.
This respect was paid by listening to Gomidas’ own musical creations.
Gomidas Vartabed was a cleric who enriched the Armenian spiritual and lay musical treasury with his talent, hard work, persistence, and passionate will, traversing Western Armenia’s villages and provinces to listen to the peasants and understand their mentality and daily life.
He harvested from the lips of older people raw, unrefined, isolated, strung-together songs; he arranged them for choral and orchestral performances.
His legacy is rescuing peasant and spiritual songs from oblivion, foreign influences, and—as it turned out—genocidal destruction.

15th gathering of Klatsor Chapter Book Lovers’ Group dedicated to Sibil (Canada)
Since February 2012, the gatherings of the Book Lovers’ Group of the Hamazkayin Klatsor Chapter (Toronto, Canada) have succeeded in presenting us the richness of the Armenian literature, giving us a chance to leave our daily hectic routines behind and revel in the works of our writers.
Thus, previous gatherings organized by the Group have given us the opportunity to admire and get inspired by the writings of such Armenian authors and poets as Vahan Derian, Siamanto, Avetis Aharonian, Antranig Dzarugian, Hagop Baronian, Hamo Sahyan, Vahagn Davtyan, and Hovhannes Tumanyan.
On Sunday, August 25, 2013 at 2:30 p.m., a group of book lovers was gathered to hear Gilda Kebabjian. Gilda had selected her topic from among the works of Armenian female writers, and Sibil (Zabel Asadour, 1863–1934), a native of Sgudar, had drawn her attention.
The event opened by Meghety Mnatsaganian, a member of the Literary Committee and Book Lovers’ Group, who invited her classmate, Gilda Kebabjian, to take the floor.
Born in Beirut, Gilda attended the kindergartens of Armenian National Schools Chatalbashian and Souren Khanamirian. Afterwards, she continued her education at the Armenian Relief Society’s (ARS) Daily School in Toronto.
She completed her high-school education at the Senator O’Conner College School. She then received a BBA with honors from the School of Administrative Studies of York University, after which she chose to specialize in accounting and received a CMA certification. She now works as a certified accountant.
She is also an active member of youth associations functioning in the Toronto Armenian Center.
Gilda opened her presentation with Arshag Chobanian’s following words on the literature of Zabel Asadour: “She wrote the most delicate and the most harmonious poems in Armenian — lines that have the delicacy of lace and crape, in which the touch of a woman’s fingers is apparent.”
The clear intonation with which Gilda spoke charmed everyone.
She presented Sibil’s biography. Born as Zabel Khanjian, Sibil was one of the founders of an association of Armenian women, called “Azkanver Hayuhyats Enkerutiun” (in Armenian), whose goal was to open Armenian girls’ schools in Constantinople and the heavily Armenian populated provinces of the Ottoman Empire. During the Armenian Genocide, the association also provided relief and care for Armenian orphans.
Sibil was fluent in French.
Following the death of her first husband, Garabed Donelian, a lawyer, Sibil married writer Hrant Asadour. Together, they published “Tankaran” (Museum), a series of textbooks.
As a seasoned teacher of Armenian language, Sibil has contributed to the education of several generations.
She had started writing at an early age. Her anthology of poems was published with the title “Tsolker” (Glimmers). She has also published the novel “Aghtchgan Meh Sirde” (A Girl’s Heart) and a collection of short stories titled “Gnotch Hokiner” (Souls of Women).
Sibil has also a number of translated works and a series of articles on the advancement of women’s rights.
She is considered as one of the Armenian Realist writers.
Referring to Sibil’s style of writing, Gilda quoted Krikor Zohrab’s following description of the female author: “Her prose is poetry and her poems are like novels.”
Sibil is mostly known as a poet. With great emotions, Gilda recited one of Sibil’s poems, “Dzovoun” (To the Sea), where the delicacy and genuineness of her literary style are evident.
Afterwards, Gilda read two excerpts from the poem “Antsnelou Mod” (About to Pass), which convey Sibil’s close bond with nature.
Next, Gilda took us back to our school years through the poem “Hay Lezoun” (The Armenian Language), where Sibil extols her “sweet mother tongue.”
Sibil is one of the greatest Armenian female writers.
Besides her literary and artistic merits, she has played a great role as an activist, an educator, and a pioneering advocate for the Armenian women’s rights movement, thus continuing and developing the path started by writer and activist Srbouhi (Vahanian) Dussap.
Toward the end of the event, on behalf of the Literary Committee, Meghety Mnatsaganian presented a souvenir to Gilda Kebabjian, thanking her for her high-quality presentation.
Gilda’s presentation increased the attendees’ interest in the works of Armenian female writers.
It will hopefully lead many of them to further read and explore their works, especially those of Sibil, who, according to Nazareth Berberian, “did not only create her own works, but also played a pioneering role in the Constantinople-based intellectual and literary movement.”

Over 250 parents, grandparents, friends, teachers, Alumni and students of Hamazkaine’s Galstaun College participated on Sunday 16 October 2011 in a Walkathon to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the College.
The Walkathon, which started in Ryde and ended at the steps of the Sydney Opera House, was organised by the College’s Parents & Friends Association with the special co-ordination of College parent Hagop Boghossian.
The initial plan was to have 25 volunteers walk 25 km to mark the 25th Anniversary of the College and with the target of raising $25,000 for the College.
Due to an overwhelming response, it soon became a much larger venture with the Walkathon having 3 stages.
Stage 1 entailed the 25 walkers starting from the HOMENETMEN - NAIRI Hall at Santa Rosa Park in Ryde and walking to the Armenian Cultural Centre in Willoughby.
In the week leading up to the Walkathon, the numbers of the walkers from Ryde to the Sydney Opera House doubled to 50.

College Business Manager, Patrick McHugh was busy co-ordinating logistics and support supplies for the walkers, including the recently acquired College Minibus.
The commencement of the Walkathon was to be launched by the Mayor or Ryde, Clr. Artin Etmekdjian however due to ill health he was unable to attend.
The walkers set off from Ryde in the early hours in near perfect weather and were warmly greeted with cheers from more participants as they arrived nearly 2 hours later at the Armenian Cultural Centre.
The Minister for Transport and Member for Willoughby, The Hon. Gladys Berejiklian gave a brief address and the students lead the community in the Hayr Mer prayer.
Numbers swelled at the second stage and included many more parents and some younger students who walked from Willoughby to Kirribilli.
By the time the Stage 2 walkers had arrived at Kirribilli, the numbers had swollen to over 250.
At this point every one, young and old, joined in the final leg in walking across the majestic Sydney Harbour Bridge, down through the historic Rocks precinct to the steps of the Sydney Opera House where they gathered for a group photo.
The tired but jubilant walkers then proceeded to the adjacent Sydney Botanical Gardens for a family picnic and a well deserved break, making the most of the picture perfect weather and beautiful harbour foreshore.
During brief formalities, special thanks and acknowledgments were made of the official sponsors – Mr & Mrs Ara Kopoushian (Onlinelighting.com.au – principal sponsor), Mr & Mrs Sarkis Der Bedrossian (Classique Watches), Mr & Mrs Sako Nalbandian, Mr & Mrs Hagop Boghossian, Mr & Mrs Hagop Der Tateosian and Mr Hovaness Manoukian as well as all the tireless organisers.

A Book Dedicated to Distinguished Artist, Song Writer and Composer Parsegh Ganachian Launched (Lebanon)
The presentation of the book Parsegh Ganachian (1885-1967) – Musicalized Life took place on Friday, March 17, 2017 at 8: 00 pm, at Yerjo Samuelian-Tricolor Hall of the National Prelacy. The event took place under the auspices of Prelate of the Armenian Diocese in Lebanon, Bishop Shahe Panossian, and was organized by the Regional Executive Board of Hamazkayin Lebanon in cooperation with the publishing house of Haigazian University.
Tamar Snabian-Sourdjian delivered the opening speech in the name of the Regional Executive Board of Hamazkayin Lebanօn and asked the audience to stand for a minute of silence in memory of former director and violin teacher of Parsegh Ganachian Music College Ashot Chenterechian.
Coming to the goal of the ceremony, Tamar Snabian-Sourdjian said that the Board aimed to pay tribute to the famous composer Parsegh Ganachian that had left an indelible mark on the music industry, and to launch a book dedicated to his 50th death anniversary.
Then, Parsegh Ganachian College teacher, soprano Shoghik Torossian performed the songs Alvard's Dream and Lullaby, accompanied on the piano by the same College teacher Hasmik Gasparian.
On the eve of the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, the "Vahe Setyan" Publishing House released the second edition of Haykazun Yapoujian’s book "Feelings of Anguish and Hope", which is the author’s memoirs describing the terrible massacres in the villages of Yozgat region and the situation of the Armenian population after the Genocide. The book provides comprehensive information about the orphanages, the establishment of the Lebanese Armenian community of Ashrafiyeh. It also gives a broad description of the national life, the church, the educational institutions and societies.
A concert dedicated to the 125th anniversary of Parsegh Ganachian’s (Canada)
The Sanahin Chapter of Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Association and the Knar Choir of Hamazkayin together celebrated the 125th anniversary of composer-musician Parsegh Ganachian’s birth on Sunday, June 12, 2011.
With the very first song one could feel and breathe in the major effort and persistence necessary for this event, and for which Varoujan Markarian, the choir conductor worked to prepare his singers.
And he succeeded in his efforts.
The songs filled the souls of the audience with their essence and rocked their memories.
Ganachian is the one of Gomidas’ four students, who faithfully adopted the master’s art of creating and collecting Armenian folk songs and music.
Without having seen the Armenian fatherland, he nourished his intellect from what he learned from Gomidas and has been true to his art.
For that very reason and to emphasize that bondage, Varoujan Markarian opened the program with the songs “Hov arek” (“Make breeze”) and “Voh inch anoush” (“Oh how sweet.”)
A well-thought novelty was the presentation of Ganachian’s life stories throughout the concert dedicated to his memory with the purpose of bringing him closer to his people.
Four sections of the video produced by the Central Committee of Hamazkayin were presented throughout the concert. The video featured Parsegh Ganachian the man, the musician, the pedagogue, and the family man, as well as his national and international acclaim, the significant merits and honors he received, and especially the Kousan Choir he formed and conducted and which had 300 members; and the role the latter played in both Ganachian’s life and in the formation of the Armenian identity in the diaspora.
In the first part of the program the following Ganachian songs were performed: “Ouri” (“The willow tree,”) one of his well-loved romantic ballads, WITH lyrics by Hovhannes Toumanian and sung by soloist Laura Bererian; “Alvarti yeraze” (“Alvart’s dream,”) lyrics by V. Mirakian and sung by soloist Hilda Okmoushian; “Dzov acher” (“Sea of eyes,”) lyrics by A. Isahagian, soloist Asdghig Esmerian; and a duet, “Tsaikerk” (“Nocturne,”) performed by Asdghig Esmerian and Hilda Okmoushian.
It is worth mentioning that the second arrangement of “Tsaikerk” is composed by Bedros Shoujounian, a former conductor of Kousan.
Ganachian’s romantic songs are valuable because they are European in their nature, but definitely Armenian in their style.
With their deep acuity of both the lyrics and the melodies of the songs they performed, the three above-mentioned soloists gave us an opportunity of genuine enjoyment. They were accompanied on the piano by Rita Shamlian, whose role was equally important in making the art of performing those songs a total success.
On this occasion, it was a great pleasure to enjoy the participation of the Nor Dzaghig Choir of St. Hagop Church.
The very meticulous work of choirmaster Elizabeth Harboian was noticeable.
The choir Nor Dzaghig filled the concert hall and the hearts of its audience with many Ganachian songs, such as “Dzidzernagi pouine” (“The swallow nest,”) lyrics by Ghazaros Aghayian, “Meghou” (“The bee”) by Kamar Katiba, accompanied on the piano by Talar Harboian.
This choir of 6-13-year-old children has already gained some experience. Its members performed with a solemnity and fineness and accompanying the Knar Choir, performed “Haireni garod” (“Yearning of the native”) by S. Shahaziz and received a lengthy ovation from the audience.
In the last part of the program Laura Berberian performed Ganachian’s “Oror” (“Lullaby.”) With her warm and expressive voice and impressive performance, she also performed “Lousnagn yelav” (“The moon has risen,”) lyrics by Levon Shant. The performance of “Naro jan” by Laura Berberian and Levon Der Atamian also received a lengthy ovation.
The duo also performed the solos of “Hele hele: Kessabi barerk” (“Hele hele: the dance of Kessab,”) thus ending the program on a lively note.
We love waiting and hoping for great things to happen. We are looking forward to the flow of a new generation of choir singers from Nor Dzaghig to Knar.
But on this occasion the lion’s share of the words of appreciation and thankfulness goes to Varoujan Markarian, the talented conductor, whose tireless efforts gave Knar the chance to breathe again. Following this successful concert, it is our wish that the number of its members increases significantly and that the quality of performance reaches such heights that the choir is a source of pride for our community.
Well done, dear servants of the Armenian culture.

“Today the internet is a reality,” emphasized Balian and added: This is completely linked to educational issues.
In our case, there is a danger of losing the language. Also, we should prepare generations who are not the slaves of the ready-at-hand.

All these need management and leadership.
This is up to the press, the educational sector, and the RA Ministry of Education.
The use of computers and Internet should be well organized.

For example, we should work against writing Armenian with Latin letters on the Internet.
In other words, all these need organization, investment, and management,” Mr. Balian said.
Afterwards, Maral Antoyian, the executive manager of the Educational Council of the Armenian Prelacy in Lebanon, talked about a computer program initiated by the Prelacy for the Armenian schools.

A Memorable Hamazkayin Weekend – Canada
It was a pleasant October weekend, which will surely be remembered by all as one of the fondest memories we’ve formed through our organization.
The weekend coincided with the Canadian Thanksgiving Day weekend, and for us Armenians, it was the Day of the Holy Translators (Sourp Tarkmanchats), an enlightened day from the pages of our history.
The Hamazkayin Canada Central Executives meticulously planned the event’s program, which took place on Saturday, October 10, 2015 at the Toronto Armenian Community Centre, in Hamazkayin’s “Haroutioun Manouguian library”.
Around a table of finger-food and deserts, members from the Montreal and Toronto communities had gathered, that had created an amiable atmosphere, away from formal meeting settings.
President of the Klatsor chapter, Ungh. Megheti Etimezian gave her opening remarks, which was followed by Hamazkayin “Nour” Festival’s committee head Ung. Sevag Yeghoyan who upon presenting a short summary on the festival’s decade-long tradition and success introduced director Jamie Day Fleck, whose documentary “Photos by Kirk” will be part of the evening’s program, as well as part of “Nour” Festival in November.
Those present watched the film with great admiration. Photos by Kirk tells the story of an Armenian Genocide survivor, Kourken Hovsepian who immigrated to America in 1920 and worked as a photographer in the Bronx from the 1920’s to 1970’s.
This film once again proves the level of Armenian talent, conviction and will to survive.
The director explained that it was through a family connection that he first through about making a film about Kourken Hovsepian’s life.
After a short lunch break, Ung. Vrej-Armen Artinian lead a debate entitled “Is it possible or not”.
The topic concentrates on the Armenian culture.
Ung. Vrej- Armen has separated the topic into 3 sections – to preserve, to transmit, to improve, which he developed with questions that sparked a debate in people’s minds.
It is clear that when we talk about Armenian culture, we mean the entire Armenian culture in it entity, however, in people’s mind Armenian language and literature take a forefront.
Those present came to the agreement that the hardest issue facing the Armenian culture today is the transmittance of the Armenian Language.
The general consensus in everyone’s mind was that to preserve means to transmit, and in order to properly transmit, one needs to improve it.
Returning back to the debate topic on whether it’s possible or not, all present agreed that it is possible, because nothing it impossible in the eyes of a surviving nation’s children when the matter in question is our nation’s and culture’s survival.
After the debate, all participants headed to Ani restaurant.
The restaurant has a familiar feeling; walls are decorated with Armenian artwork, hearts are filled with warm feeling of being surrounded by friends, the sweet aroma of the delicious food to come and the talented Armenian jazz band- Liquid Trio Band filled the atmosphere with soft melodies. 
As is in our tradition, Armenian shourchbar dance took place. The space is limited, but that won’t stop an Armenian dancer from finding a way to keep the dance going.
Hamazkayin Canada’s Central Executive president Ungh. Dzovig Kahvedjian thanked the organizing committee members for their devotion and for bringing this event together from idea to reality.
President of the Montreal Sanahin Chapter, ungh. Tamar Chahinian Poladian presented the jazz band, the trio of incredible and talented musicians.
She then thanked the Central Executive of Canada for bringing all members together in this warm and friendly atmosphere, for organizing an incredible agenda, which will also include a visit to one of Canada’s most beautiful places – Niagara-on-the-Lake.
The next morning was a beautiful and sunny Sunday. Everyone headed to Niagara Falls, which is an incredible opportunity especially for the Montreal chapter members, to see one of Canada’s great natural wonders.
After many landscape and group pictures, the group finally arrived to Niagara-on-the-Lake.
Under the sunny skies, participants walked around the vineyard of famous winery Peller Estates where they were also able to visit small shops and boutiques, or simply enjoy the beautiful countryside.
Under the clear skies, surrounded by wine crates, with an assortment of cheeses and wine bottles, members sat together, and the toasts continued.
A short presentation from the local estate representative explained how the wine is prepared, including the famous icewine, a guided tour of the fields and fields of grape vines. It was amazing to hear about Mr. Peller’s futuristic vision. He was a doctor, who didn’t have any clue about wine, but years ago found the right opportunity and by bringing together the right people founded this estate, that has now become world renowned.
Cheers to Hamazkayin, who amidst all difficulties has managed for the past 88 years to work endlessly to promote the Armenian culture.

“Seta’s biography lies in the books she has published,” Mr. Aprahamian said.
“The book is a story of a collision with life,” Hagop Balian said about the book. He added that all nine short stories and 20 articles are a collision with a good or bad reality, while the heroes of her stories are both positive and negative characters who come from the pulse of the people.
Mr. Balian said that Seta Krikorian’s stories are effortlessly understood by the reader because for a moment she forgets that she’s creating literature and instead tells her story.

Ms. Krikorian said the meeting is the first of many in the upcoming year and that this time around, the number of attendees is very encouraging.
Mr. Apelian said there are 17 eyewitness accounts in the first volume and 23 in the second.
Mr. Apelian confirmed there are many ethnic Armenians in Syria and elsewhere, who have become Kurds, but are proud of their Armenian identity, despite being displaced from an Armenian society.
Those Armenians encounter identity problems, since they are both Armenians and Kurds at the same time and both societies have difficulties in accepting them.
Mr. Apelian also spoke about the process of collecting eyewitness accounts and of his experiences and difficulties on the way, as well as the reaction of the people he encountered.
He expressed hope to reach up to 100 accounts by the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.

Organized by the “Pakin” literary Magazine, a reading dedicated to the volume “Identity, quality, culture, and restitution” by Hagop Balian, the editor-in-chief of “Pakin” Literary Magazine, took place Wednesday, June 15, 2011, at 7:00 PM, at the editorial offices of “Pakin.”
The book has been awarded the Kevork Melidinets Literary Award. The book is divided into two parts: the first “The identity of a nation is the summation of fundamental values,” while the second, “The Armenian culture: the keystone of the true restitution.”
Associate editor Seta Krikorian welcomed the audience, after which Dr. Seta Kilejian presented the book.
Acknowledging Balian’s thoughts, Dr. Kilejian mentioned that identity is not built without culture and that the Armenian individual should be introduced to other cultures, yet should deeply perceive it own national identity.
Ms. Kilejian said that besides examining concerns, Balian also proposes suggestions and solutions that should be considered by Armenian national authorities.
Dr. Kilejian added that the Armenian language is endangered since we are being proud of it, which is a sad situation.
She added that in his writings Balian has often raised the alarm about the unity of the fatherland, language and culture, and yet his warnings have not been heard.
Dr. Kilejian also said that the author keeps touching the same problems over different periods of time with the hope of finding solutions.
She also reflected on the content of Balian’s writings, which touch such topics as the danger hanging upon the Armenian language and the retreat of reading, to mention some.
Afterwards Balian once again stated that the Armenian nation is losing its spirit day after day and that we are not seriously enough discussing the situation in national schools.
He said that the mission of the Armenian school is not to succeed in official exams, but the education they provide.
He also said that a nation cannot be guided without perspective and ideology.
After touching some of the negative aspects of the Armenian national life, Mr. Balian said that our press should be the ground where all these issues are discussed.
Toward the end of the meeting the audience had a friendly conversation with the author and the other speakers on various Armenian national topics.

Academic conference entitled “Critical Approaches to Armenian Identity in the 21st Century: Vulnerability, Resilience, and Transformation” in Istanbul
On October 6-7 of this year, the Hrant Dink Foundation and Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society organized a joint academic conference entitled “Critical Approaches to Armenian Identity in the 21st Century: Vulnerability, Resilience, and Transformation” in Istanbul.
On that very day, the media gave extensive coverage of the event.
During the conference, thirty reports were made presenting the results of theoretical or practical researches.
The reports could be made in Armenian, English or Turkish. Immediate interpretation was provided.
After each speech, the speakers had the opportunity to answer the questions from the audience.
The reports included the presentation and discussions on the identity concept in general, as well as the issue of the Armenian identity in the Diaspora and in Turkey, in religion and literature.
The Hrant Dink Foundation will publish the full report on the conference in a special volume in the future.
After the release of the book, the experts will have the opportunity to thoroughly and clearly examine the capacity and value of the submitted researches.
Before having this chance, it should be clearly confirmed that the accomplishment of this academic conference in itself contained a deep symbolic meaning, and created apparent satisfaction among the participants, especially during the meetings and consultation outside normal working hours.
Indeed, the memory being one of the main identity creators, and the chosen location - Istanbul, being the actual birthplace of literary Western Armenian and having a glorious past of national activities, not only made the theme of the conference substantial but also subjective. In such atmosphere, the scientific approach and the inner world could create a framework for free dialogue on the basis of equal rights.
It was also pleasant for guests to be in an absolutely pan-Armenian environment. There were representatives from Armenia and from the communities of western and eastern Diaspora, and, naturally, from Istanbul and other parts of Turkey.
The Hamazkayin Society has been directly communicating with Istanbul Armenians for years. The conference on Armenian identity, organized in cooperation with the Hrant Dink Foundation, was the first initiative.
The result is very encouraging.
Surely this cooperation will be continuous and many other successful events will be organized.

Annual Poetry Recital Competition Held in Canada
The very word competition causes anxiety in many people. When the nature of the competition is reciting a poem in front of a large public, we can understand how much greater the anxiety might be, especially for a student with little prior experience.
Thus, at the competition held on May 5, 2019, at the Armenian Community Centre in Toronto, each student participant deserved congratulations.
Poetry recital has become a special part of our cultural legacy over the millennia. It has developed alongside theater from the playhouses of Dikranagerd and Ardashad to the twentieth century.
It developed further, as a separate art, in the early twentieth century, when schools started including public speaking and theatrical readings in their curricula.
Armenia and the diaspora have given birth to numerous talented poetry reciters; but there are few true masters.
The Hamazkayin Toronto “Klatsor” Chapter’s Literary Committee has a tradition of annual poetry recital competitions to encourage those who are inclined to give it a try or have shown some talent in the past. The competition also serves Hamazkayin’s mission of keeping Armenian language and writing alive.
This year’s competition was for contestants in the fifth through twelfth grades. They were split into three groups: Grades 5 and 6; Grades 7 and 8; and Grades 9 through 12. The committee had selected a list of poems for each group. Each student was to select and present one poem from the list.
The emcee, Armineh Torikian, notes the special anniversaries associated with the poets whose works appear on the list: Hovhannes Tumanian and Levon Shant were born 150 years ago, Moushegh Ishkhan and Hamo Sahyan were born 105 years ago, Silva Kaputikian and Gevorg Emin were born a century ago, Paruyr Sevak would have been 95 this year, Sibil died 85 years ago. And so on.
She also introduced the jury: Ruben Mnatzakanian, Varak Babian, and Tamar Donabedian Kuzuian. The members are writers and reciters of poetry.
The participants, 35 in all, came from St. Gregory the Illuminator Saturday school and the Armenian Relief Society day school.
From the very first performance, it was clear that the students were well prepared. The jury had its work cut out for it.
The differences in style made the competition, and the jury’s task, all the more interesting.
The jury focused on four points: pronunciation or prosody; fluidity; interpretation; general presentation.
While the jury was making its decision, the experienced teacher and poetry reciter Moushegh Karakashian shared some thoughts about poetry recital with the students and enriched the program with a recital of his own.
The moment of truth arrived. The emcee called the winning students to the stage one by one.
The results were as follows:
Grades 5 and 6: First place: Suzy Kunashian and Garni Margarian, Second place: Elena Farajian, Third place: Lena Mahdesian
Grades 7 and 8: First place: Sarin Kabrielian, Second place: Izabel Akob and Shayla Giragosian, Third place: Lilit Najarian and Liza Hovagimian
Grades 9 through 12: First place: Lori Berberian and Aris Chuljian, Second place: Gevorg Danayan and Sara Bayrakdarian, Third place: Juliana Donoyan and Elizabeth Kandaharian
At the end of the program, all the students were given books as presents. The books were provided by the Hamazkayin Book Dissemination and Library Committee.
In addition, the winners received two tickets each for a future Hamazkayin song or dance performance.
Everyone who participated deserves warm applause.
The parents and teachers who encouraged and worked with the students made their performances possible.
Understanding the poetry, capturing the spirit of the poet, conveying the feelings aroused by the poem to the audience requires experience and talent.
We believe Toronto has talented poetry reciters who need experience to grow into their roles. We will be seeing them onstage in the years to come.

Arevi marte” (“The man of Sun”) book launch (Canada)
Organized by Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Association’s book publishing committee, an event dedicated to the volume “Arevi marte” by Rouben Mnatsakanian took place on Sunday, June 10, 2012, at the H. Manoogian Library in Toronto.
Tamar Donabedian hosted the event.
In her opening speech she cited verses from the book, as well as featured Rouben Mnatsakanian, a member of Hamazkayin, as someone who is just, a clear person, and an enthusiastic Armenian.
Born in Tehran, Mnatsakanian graduated from Kushesh Davtian Armenian High School and studied economics and governance, and has also worked as a goldsmith.
Since 1980 he has lived in Toronto.
He is married to Marina and they have three children.
He has contributed to the Armenian papers “Alik” and “Horizon.” The book “Arevi marte” is his fourth.
Since 1999 he has published three other volumes: “Yev” (“And,”) “Jeghkvadz Arev” (“Fractured sun,”) and “Arevi yergir” (“Land of sun.”)
For being a servant to the Armenian literature, he is decorated with the medal of Sourp Asdvadzadzin Church.
Throughout the art program, Megheti, Aren, and Tsolineh Mnatsakanian, as well as Sevag Harutunian and Caroline Khoushabeh recited various verses, each of which affirmed the diverse meanings of the book “Arevi marte.”
Rosa Safarian-Der Haroutiounian featured the book.
She was born in Tehran and studied at local Armenian schools.
She graduated from Yerevan State University where she studied Armenian language and literature.
Afterwards she had a career as a teacher, lecturer, translator, editor, and columnist in Tehran and Toronto and is the author of the book “Anaghard bahenk mayrenin” (“Let’s keep our mother language pure.”)
Rosa Der-Haroutiounian started her review by viewing literature as one of the highest human intellectual expressions.
The topics of poems by Mnatsakanian are the issues that interest his people, the present and the future, the yearning towards fatherland, love, struggle towards deception, and emotions such as eagerness and apathy.
Ms. Der-Haroutiounian explained that the sun is a source of inspiration for Mnatsakanian: it is his muse, and the motive for his work.
The poet presented the sun as a source of warmth that can make man reach the heights of his dreams.
Ms. Ter-Haroutiounian analysed that in his poems Mnatsakanian struggles toward a cruel reality and the moral and physical dangers that threaten the world.
His poems inspire the reader to fight against weaknesses and preserve the sacred fire of his soul, to ennoble himself and to love mankind.
Ms. Ter-Haroutiounian described Mnatsakanian’s style as simple and compact, and full of meaning at the same time.
He converses with the reader.
He is genuine.
Ms. Ter-Haroutiounian mentioned some of the poems by Mnatsakanian that are dedicated to his roots and his people, especially the Diasporan who remains linked to his past, his identity, his language and culture, and who considers them sacred entities.
Ms. Ter-Haroutiounian supported her review by citing corresponding poems and verses.
The event host thanked Rosa Ter-Haroutiounian for her deep insights into the book. Afterward, she invited to the stage professional singer and songwriter Anahid Goudsouzian, who has turned one of Mnatsakanian’s poems into a song.
With her tender voice and accompaniment on the piano, Ms. Goudsouzian gave life to the poem “Giank” (“Life.”)
Then it was Ruben Mnatsakanian’s turn to deliver his heartfelt words.
After expressing his gratitude, the poet talked about the sun featured in the book “Arevi marte.” He said it is something eternal. He called the globe a guesthouse and man is standing in the middle.
After a question and answer session, Sossie Tashjian presented a memento on behalf of Hamazkayin’s book promotion group.
Following a reception, the author signed copies of his books.
Tamar Donabedian, the event host, said: “Every time that a book is published our alphabet gets a new life, and when we read that book we guarantee the vigor of our centennial language.
Today is another opportunity to give new breath to our golden language.”

Armenian Lyric Poetry (Canada)
Speaking, communicating and creating in the native language seems very ordinary for many peoples, because their generations learn and hear their mother tongue since their birth, study every sound and word of it in the language of their ancestors.
Their mentality and logic develop in the language they speak, comprehend and gradually master.
The successive generations of the Armenian people living in the Diaspora have not been just as fortunate as the Armenians living in the Homeland. Staying Armenian and speaking Armenian is rather a fight for them than a usual process of language development.
The true fact is that in the 21st century the greatest challenge for an Armenian in the Diaspora, for which he makes every effort, is the preservation of the Western Armenian language and its correct usage․
The event aimed at this issue took place on Sunday, 1 May 2016 at 2.00 pm at the Armenian Center’s "Y. Manoogian" Library.
The gathering, organized by the members of "Book Club" of the Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society, was dedicated to the Armenian lyric poetry.

Then, she invited Varag Mesrobian and Christopher Kostanian to the stage.
After a brief speech made by Varag, the boys performed the song "My Brother and I", which encouraged and impressed the audience.

Tamar Donabedian presented clear and concise descriptions and history, noting that the poets’ personal experience of love, hatred and nostalgia dominate in their poetry, and very often are hidden in the footnotes.
Then she quoted the poems of the lyrical writers and performed Teryan’s "Sadness".

The emcee, Lilit Demirdjian, welcomed everyone. Jacques Hagopian then spoke on behalf of the branch.

The branch, he said, planned to organize more specialized events in the future and to involve children in Armenian schools.
He thanked the administrators of the Yeghishe Manoukian and United Armenian Colleges and the M. and H. Arslanian Djemaran for encouraging their students to participate in the event.
“We find ourselves in an era where there is retreat in every field, including culture, and literature is in the most vulnerable place,” Mr. Hagopian asserted, hoping that the event would be a chance to enjoy the erstwhile glory of Armenian lyric poetry.

The lecture consisted of 3 sessions, which took place in the presence of 20 listeners.
At the first session on Saturday, the lecturer presented the ideology of race developed in Europe at the end of the 17th century.
The ideology, compared with other "colored" races, gave preference to the so-called white race and eventually caused a lot of disaster in the world. It still, in various ways, exists in America and elsewhere.
The second session took place after the afternoon lunch. Dr. Vartan Mateossian spoke about the Armenians’ emigration to the United States, and the American racist behavior towards the Armenians and other "inferior" refugees.
Quoting from testimonies, statistics and a number of legal and other documents, Dr. Vartan Mateossian thoroughly described the discriminatory atmosphere that reigned in America in 1880s, from the very beginning of Armenians’ arrival until 1950, and later dates.
In this context, the lecturer presented the judicial cases of Hallajian (1909) and Gartozian (1924) families excited in connection with their US citizenship. Then he spoke about Garegin Nzhdeh’s activities in the United States in1930s, focusing on the National Covenant (Tseghakron) movement, its establishment, and Nzhdeh’s Nation and Tribe doctrine.
The third session took place on Sunday morning. It concerned the discriminations towards the Armenians in Fresno, California, where the largest number of Armenians had settled after reaching America, in the first decades of the century․
The lecturer mentioned that the native white population had special feelings of envy towards the naked and barefoot refugees, which in a very short period succeeded in creating a prosperous life.
Professor concluded his speech saying that we should not forget that unfair situation, which the first emigrants and their immediate descendants underwent, and be vigilant today towards any discriminatory behavior.

Parents and teachers were invited to enjoy the best performances of students.
Chair of the Paruyr Sevak Chapter of Hamazkayin Valley, Berj Uzunyan welcomed the guests and gave brief information about the event. He said that 123 students had participated in the contests of drawing, essay writing, song, music, recitation, and dance from five different schools, namely from Armenian Sisters Academy, Alex Pilibos, Chamlian, Mesrobian, and Ferahian Schools. Then he invited to the stage the conductor of the event, Maral Varjabedian, who had taken over the overall organization of the contest.
Varjabedian said, "One of the best ways to attract the new generation is to organize similar events in cooperation with teachers and administrations of Armenian schools. We succeeded in doing it working with our Armenian teachers for the past six months.
Today’s event is an opportunity for students to understand and appreciate this important and unique experience, which will never be erased from their youthful memories."
Then she added. "The students learn a lot in their school years and generally forget a great deal of what they learn. However, they will never forget such events and will keep them in their mind and soul."
Varjabedian concluded her speech by saying: "Today, the Hamazkayin Cultural Association is successfully carrying out its mission in preparing the culture lover generation of tomorrow."
Artsakh Artists Take Lebanon by Storm

Hagop Havatian, director of the gallery and press, spoke.
“This event lays the groundwork for our cooperation with Artsakh and I am sure that the first initiative will lead to further steps and closer ties by the day.”
He said the cooperation had a “deeply meaningful message” because Artsakh needs, now more than ever, the support of Armenians.
The Hamazkayin Office in Artsakh is aware of the importance of support for Artsakh from Armenian communities worldwide and works in all the border villages and regions where “there is the daily fear and awareness of the enemy.”
Ashot Harutyunyan’s Canvases on Display in Lebanon
Hamazkayin’s Lucy Tutunjian Gallery in Beirut on April 11, 2019, held an opening reception for a solo exhibit of the paintings of Ashot Harutyunyan, an artist from Armenia.
On display are 22 oils, 9 works of mixed media on paper, and two illustrated doors.
Angela Daghlian of the gallery staff said that art aspires to perfection, but it has a supreme secret; it requires effort and willpower to remain faithful to that secret and to unlock it requires talent and confidence.
In painting, she said, the secret is simplicity and lack of pretense, which allows the artist to penetrate the depths of the human and natural worlds, to interpret what is familiar and to plumb our essence.
Ms. Daghlian said that Mr. Haruyunyan was nourished and formed in the Armenian world.
He brings with him the sweet smell of home, the faraway but living atmosphere of the Armenian village. He portrays the silence and pure sky of the Armenian village and the dream of our occupied land, etching it into our hearts.

Astounding Dance Performance (Canada)
Sometimes when you try to describe a performance you feel unable to find the right word for it, because no words can exactly describe what you feel when watching it.
Such was the annual concert given by the students of the Hamazkayin Choreographic College and the "Erebuni" Dance Ensemble. The performance took place at the weekend of June 25-26, 2016, at "Hamazkayin" Hall of the Armenian Youth Center of Toronto. More than 900 hundred spectators attended the concerts in two days. The performance, due to the dancers’ gorgeous costumes, unique staging and excellent quality, will undoubtedly stay as a memorable event in the history of the Armenian Community of Toronto and of the Gladzor Chapter of Hamazkayin Toronto.
The performed artistic program filled our hearts with pride.
The "Puy-Puy Mouse" reminded us about our childhood, the "Memoirs" took us to our past, "Artashat" made us stronger, "Kalinka" took us far away to Russia and "Kochari" transfered us to our eternal anchor called Homeland.
The little dancers of C and D groups of Hamazkayin Choreographic College, with smiling faces and wide open eyes, were standing behind the curtain and were impatiently waiting for their turn. They were rolling their heads to right and left, and their forefingers on their lips, they were watching one another and following their instructors that were carefully guarding them.
As soon as the music started the children ran out to the stage and started to exercise on their carpets.
It was one of the open dance classes displayed to the audience. The instructor joined the group, carefully examined each of the dancers, gave instructions to them, and the rehearsal of the dancers from Hamazkayin Choreographic College and "Erebuni" Dance Ensemble started. Artistic director and dance instructor Lori Najarian has been working with children for more than 6 years.
The song "Hayastan" (We and Our Mountains) started, and from both sides of the stage the college juniors entered the stage and started their performance.
The bright rosy cheeked dancers were so enthusiastic when they hand in hand and in proportionate steps entered the stage, turning the concert into a real feast and receiving roaring applause.
Then, the next dance started immediately.
Mother mouse (Karin Matossian) entered the stage and started to examine all around, while the little mice (young dancers of B group) would appear on the stage shaking their long tails right and left.
"Puy-puy Mouse" was on stage. The moving pictures on the screen gave additional charm to the performance. The mice continued their exciting play on the stage when the cats appeared (Adrineh Artin and Titer Karkotsian).
Then, from children’s world we moved to the world of heroic Artsakh. The boys in silver and blue velvet costumes were singing "Gyulum Jan" ("Erebuni" Dance Ensemble) standing side by side in imposing posture, which showed the assertiveness of Artsakh people. Instructor Lori Najarian's solo dance in a very gorgeous costume attracted everybody’s attention.
"Enzeli" was performed by older students of the college. They captured attention with their harmonious and graceful movements and costumes in bold and vivid colors. Shaking us over the waves, they transferred us to the blue world of love.
The dance "Memoirs" woke the memories of the past. For a moment it seemed we were in Teryan's "Twilight Dreams" when the graceful girls of "Erebuni" Dance Ensemble smoothly entered the stage.
They were dancing as if wrapped in the clear blue sky and were gracefully gliding in the air with sparkling ornaments on their heads.
Very graceful and attractive was Maria Martirosyan’s solo dance.
The solemn entrance and the playful dance of our naughty shepherds, sheltered in the native mountains, and of their chief shepherd (Armen Artin) created a lot of enthusiasm in the hall. The boy "Cranes" appeared on the stage and took us into their proportionate flocks, after which the clocks turned back, and we found ourselves in the arms of a legend - the very inspiring dance called "Spindles" and performed by the girls of "Erebuni" Dance Ensemble. "Folk Dance" started and the snappy movements of dancers excited the audience. Now, the "Vagharshapat" Trio (on Saturday – Meghedi Gosdanian, Melina Galtakian, Dvin Garachian and on Sunday - Sarin Charshafian, Marina Kalousdian, Karin Matossian) is on stage.
We should note that each dance was accompanied by corresponding images on the screen in the background, which perfectly enriched the overall performance.
The short videos made by Armen Garo Melkonian and Artur Grigorian, displayed during the program, expressed the feelings of dancers towards the dance, and what the dance ment to them.
The dance "Armenia is mine" by children of A. Group was performed with high sense of pride. The dancers were like little bold soldiers.
Sardarapat monuments was on the screen. From among the trees, the tricolor waved high and the dancers of "Erebuni" performed the dance "Haygazunner". It was a great, harmonious and dynamic performance showing our combative spirit of liberation struggle. That spirit will help us have Armenia. The hands were in the air, and there were feet-beating and continuous clapping. "The song of Armenia" gathered the dancers of all ages on the stage creating a gorgeous view.
Then, in the second part of the program, the famous Russian "Kalinka" was performed. The sparkling costumes, flawless flights and sinuous movements of "Erebuni" boys and girls impressed the audience, especially the Russian audience, which highly appreciated the performance at the end of the evening.
The pictures of white-walled houses and the blue waters of the Mediterranean took us to the country of Greeks. Opa՜ ... was heard and "Sirtaki" started.
The accurate line of the young girls and their proportionate steps were impressive.
From Greece we moved to Spain. Lana Ter-Petrosyan's dance from "Erebuni" was passionate and very impressive. She performed Spanish Flamenco, which brought even more diversity to the program.
We couldn’t help admiring the Ukrainian "Hobak". The girls with striking head gears and dressed like dolls and the boys in red shoes and with tied up waists were like from the world of fairy tales.
From that fairy-tale land, we moved to the world of epic heroes, called the land of Artsakh, and the dance "Artashat", dedicated to our heroes, thundered the stage. This superb dance was performed by "Erebuni" adult dancers.
Then, the G group little dancers performed "Hayastan" with great inspiration, which was followed by a delicate dance of "Erebuni" girls called "Blossomed Cherry". It was accompanied by gentle music and beautiful view in pink colors.
Then, once again "Kochari" started and made everybody be up. The passionate dance of "Erebuni" boys closed the evening and everybody in the hall hand in hand created groups and started to dance. The glorious evening reached its peak.
The audience stood up. Long applause continued.
The spectators really enjoyed the performance. The expressions on faces of dancers, their cocky, imposing postures, smooth, proportionate movements, perfectly staged by Lori Najarian dances really had inspired the audience.
Long-term dancer Hovhannes Harutyunian presented a bunch of flowers to Lori. She delivered a speech, thanked everybody, and informed that from September she is going to continue education in the field of choreography in Armenia.
Gladzor Chapter’s Chair Melody Etyemezian spoke about Lori’s virtues, and her meticulous, selfless and dedicated approach to her work, wishing her success and progress.
She also highly appreciated the work of the Dance Committee representative Alin Donabedian-Tosunian for her diligent, consistent, unselfish and tireless volunteer work for six years.
The memorable evening was closed by Archpriest Rev. Fr. Gomidas Panossian’s cordial congratulation speech, prayers and blessings.
The performance was an evident success due to Lori Najarian’s high quality teaching and artistic taste and the consistent hard work of the Hamazkayin soldiers.
Titanic undertaking and titanic work had been done. By Lori, Executive Board members, auxiliaries, parents, sponsors and finally, by more than 150 dancers from the Choreographic College and "Erebuni" Dance Ensemble.
We left the hall full of pride, wishing the best for Lori. The Hamazkayin will surely continue its mission, and in the nearest future, the Armenian dance will once again be presented and promoted on the stages in the head of a new instructor.
As Lori said, the Armenian dance is a cultural treasure, which every Armenian should know and appreciate. It is a treasure, which we should and must preserve and propagate.
We wish luminous way to Lori and strength and vigor to Hamazkayin.
Our dance is eternal like our mountains.

At First Plenary, Hamazkayin Central Executive Adopts an Ambitious Agenda
The Central Executive Board of the Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society held its first plenary meeting of its 2018–22 term on September 8, 9, and 10, 2018, in Yerevan.
First on the agenda was a review of each region’s recent activities; the board was pleased to note the steady growth of the network of newly formed organizational units, as well as an increase in the number of young members, especially in the three North American regions.
Those three regions and the regional executives in the Middle East are active and lively. The Regional Executive Board for Syria has also been revitalized. The European and South American regions, however, continue to face challenges requiring additional organizational efforts and attention.
Revitalizing those regions will be high on the Central Executive Board’s agenda during its four-year term.
On this note, the meeting was informed of programs underway or planned for the next few months to mark Hamazkayin’s 90th anniversary in the various regions.
This series of celebrations was launched with great fanfare on September 9 with a celebration at Yerevan’s Sundukyan National Academic Theater.
The board then considered, one by one, the resolutions of Hamazkayin’s Eighth General Assembly, which had taken place in Yerevan in May and form a road map for the society’s activities over the next four years.
Under educational matters, the meeting examined the administrative and academic issues of the educational establishments working under the auspices of the Central Executive Board.
The board evaluated the matter of Armenian education and the work of the principals of the M. & H. Arslanian Djemaran in Beirut, the Hamazkayin Djemaran in Marseilles, and the Arshak and Sophie Galstaun Djemaran in Sydney.
The board noted with satisfaction the completion of the new Raffi and Anelga Arslanian Nursery building in Beirut and the fact that the school would start accepting children in September.
The board paid especial attention to the activities of the École Hamaskaïne-Tarkmantchatz in Issy-les-Moulineaux, outside Paris, and decided to continue its commitment to the institution.
Reflecting on the program to prepare future Armenian-language teachers for Armenian schools in the diaspora, the board decided to increase publicity efforts for Yerevan State University master’s program in Armenian studies, which is being implemented in conjunction with Hamazkayin.
This program is already bearing fruit; young teachers with master’s degrees from this program are already working in diaspora Armenian schools.
On the same note, the board decided to increase publicity for the master’s program for school administrators.
The meeting looked at other Hamazkayin institutions separately. The annual reports of the Vahe Setian Press, the Hamazkayin Publishing House, and the Lucy Tutunjian Art Gallery were examined. The board found that these programs must be modernized. For example, an online library should be developed; the quality of the publications should be raised; and the gallery should have the means to refresh its collection.
Reflecting on Pakin, the meeting was pleased to note that the editor and editorial board have drawn a considerable number of younger writers to the magazine.
The board examined the work of the organization’s Beirut, Armenia, Artsakh, and Javakheti offices.
The focus was on the newly established offices; the board wished to expand the activities of the Hamazkayin Artsakh and Javakheti offices, so that they might create new opportunities for Hamazkayin to contribute to the development of cultural life in those two regions.
The board was pleased with the success of the “Lala and Ara” children’s games and decided to expand that program and to accelerate the development of new electronic games and the production of “Lala and Ara” products.
A new platform for young people on the Internet, “H-Pem,” is under development. The board examined the report on this project and the next steps to quickly roll out this platform to the youth.
The board emphasized that this platform was essential to the society’s mission of keeping new generations—who are subject to cultural decay in the diaspora—inside the sphere of Armenian culture.
The meeting touched upon the society’s three programs devised to keep young Armenians in communion with their Armenian identity and culture: the Student Gathering (“Forum”) in Armenia; the ArtLinks youth network in North America, and the newly formed YouthLinks in Europe.
The board concluded that the annual growth in the number of participants is evidence of the success of the programs, and that all three programs successfully connect Armenian youth with Armenia, Armenian culture, and Armenian identity.
The board thus decided to spare no effort or means to ensure the continued success of these programs.
On public relations and outreach, the board found it important to increase Hamazkayin’s publicity efforts. The board made decisions to ensure that the public will be informed, on an ongoing basis, of the society’s work.
At the meeting’s end, all the members of the Central Executive Board paid a visit to the Armenia’s Diaspora Minister Mkhitar Hayrapetyan.
The newly appointed minister spoke of his ministry’s approach to relations with Armenian communities worldwide and said new resources were being allocated to support Armenian education in the diaspora.
The chairperson of the Central Executive Board, in turn, congratulated the minister on his appointment and spoke of the society’s educational and youth-oriented programs.
The participants had a beneficial exchange of thoughts on the possibility of future cooperation between the ministry and Hamazkayin.

At Toronto Event, Translators Read from Their Work
When we page through our literature, and especially when we read the biographies of classical writers, we invariably come across these lines: “The author’s works have been translated into the following languages” or “The author has translated works from the following languages.”
Usually, we glide past these lines and figure the author was prominent enough to warrant translation or knew another language well enough to translate literature written in it.
Translating a simple new story is itself an art. “These are the words, but what is the author trying to say?” asks the translator, and the matter becomes complicated.
Translating a literary piece is many times harder. How to convey the tone of the piece, the mood, the breath, the spirit? How to remain true to the author?
It goes without saying that literary translation is an art in which few succeed.
Four years ago, a folder reached my hands; it contained the translation, by Rupen Janbazian into Armenian of two pieces by William Saroyan.
I recall the sense of pride I experienced. “Good for you, Rupen,” I said.
Around the same time, I noticed the monthly Toronto Hye was carrying translations, by Varak Babian, on one, two, five, ten exceptional works by classical poets and prose writers.
Familiar with the source materials, I continued to exclaim, “Good for you!”
It became clear that the Literary Committee of the Hamazkayin Toronto Chapter should gave an important part of its annual program over to translated works.
The day is Sunday. It is September 29, 2019. At the Hamazkayin Library in Toronto, seated behind the desk, are Varak Babian and Rupen Janbazian, who were born in Toronto, attended the ARS Day School, grew up in actively Armenian families, and were nourished by the breath of the homeland.
Armine Torikian, a member of the committee, speaks. In a few words, she reflects on the history of Armenian translation, its importance, and the role of the translator. She said the translator’s role is often that of the artist.
Of course, for us, the role of the translator becomes more tangible when the translator is the young person sitting before us.
Varak describes the spiritual connection between himself and Rudyard Kipling’s “If”; Moushegh Ishkhan’s translation of the poem hung by the wall abutting the desk of his late father, Kalusd Babian.
Because of his father’s work, Varak often translated. His interest began at home.
His selections are Derian and Tekeyan, Zarifian and Shiraz, Tourian, and more.
Varak shares his view as a translator: “Your rendition must be accurate and faithful, not artificial.” He then reads excerpts from Derian, Shiraz, and Zarifian. First he reads the Armenian source material, then his English translation.
We have the chance to feel the balance of the rhymes, the selection of terms, and the general feeling the two versions leave us with. We are not literary critics but lovers of Armenian literature, and we are impressed.
Varak is also a fan of Aram Haygaz’s; he has undertaken the project of translating all of the author’s Yerchangutiun. We await the fruits of his labors.
Rupen Janbazian is next to present.
Rupen believes that, along its other benefits, translation is a way to bring young people who do not read Armenian closer to our literature.
As a young man born in Toronto, Rupen takes the view, “Whether or not we like it, we think in English, we translate ourselves from English to Armenian every day.
Translation is, for our generation, a consequence of assimilation, but also a way to fight assimilation.
Rupen and Varak are demanding toward themselves, meticulous about striving for the best, not just speaking and writing Armenian, but speaking and writing standard Armenian.
Rupen reads his 2014 translation of Andranik Tzarukian’s work, “A Vow to Ararat.” In the English rendition, we feel Tzarukian’s proud will, his spirit.
Rupen recounts his conversations with the translator Tatul Sonentz.
Sonentz considers translation a biography for every nation; “after all, civilization is human civilization and no one nation can usurp human civilization.
Translation is very important for bringing nations closer to each other. We have become a worldwide nation. We write and create in various languages. We cannot understand each other without translation.”
We listen with pleasure to Rupen’s translation into Armenian of Saroyan.
We had, in 2018, already heard excerpts from the translation of Letter to Yerevan by Rupen Janbazian and Tatul Sonentz.
The community is fortunate to boast such committed, talented youth.

The presentation, organized by the Regional Executive Board of Hamazkayin Lebanon, took place on Wednesday, October 25, 2017, at 8:30 pm, at Hagop Der Melkonian Theater.
Tamar Snabian-Sourdjian delivered the opening speech before the screening began. She said that the film Women of 1915 was highly appreciated, and had already received more than a dozen awards in different parts of the world. Then she added that the renowned artist Bared Maronian’s film presents the Armenian woman from different aspects – as a rustic woman, patriot, Fedayeen, creator, embroiderer, and mother.
Besides the Armenian women, the film, in a separate chapter, tells also about the foreign women. Those women were public figures, teachers, missionaries, who manifested remarkable humane features, left their own peaceful lives and stood up to defend the helpless Armenian people.
For about an hour and a half the spectators watched the scenes of severe disaster of the Armenian Genocide; the tortures and sufferings of the Armenian people, and the horrors that the Armenian women went through. However, the film at the same time showed their determination to survive, their will to live and struggle, and to help others to live.
The film told also about those foreign philanthropist sisters who had left their peaceful countries and had rushed to the Armenian people to show support and to stretch out a helping hand so that they could save the Armenian orphans.

Boghos Shahmelikian’s “A Journey into Memory” Celebrated in Beirut
On the evening of June 13, 2019, Aztag Daily and the Hamazkayin Literary Chapter organized an evening for Boghos Shahmelikian’s new book, Jamportutiun Hishoghutian Mech (A journey into memory), under the auspices of Archbishop Nareg Alemezian, prelate of the Armenians of Lebanon.
The evening’s opening words were given by one of the editors of Aztag, Jacques Hagopian, who noted that this meeting was the first of a series of book launches and literary-intellectual seminars, organized by Aztag editors and Hamazkayin’s Literary Chapter.
Although there may be the impression that Armenian literary life is wilting, that intellectuals and writers are abandoning the front lines, that they have nothing left to say, nonetheless, especially in the diaspora, there are cultivators of Armenian thought—warriors of a sort—who are still creating, and with their work adding something to the Armenian literary legacy of many centuries.
One of those “cultivators of Armenian thought” is the writer Boghos Shahmelikian, Mr. Hagopian said. His Journey into Memory consists of artistic images in the nature of a memoir.

Catholicos Aram I honored writer Chris Bohjalian with the Mesrob Mashdots Medal
Organized by the Hamazkayin ' Vahe Sethian" Printing & Publishing House, and under the high patronage and in the presence of His Holiness Catholicos Aram I, a book-signing event dedicated to American-Armenian writer Chris Bohjalian’s novel The Sandcastle Girls took place on Monday, December 3, 2012 at 7:00 p.m., at the Gulbenkian Hall of the Armenian Catholicosate of Cilicia in Antelias. The event was attended by a large number of ministers, Lebanese Parliament members, representatives of various associations, and book lovers.
Hagop Havatian, director of the ' Vahe Sethian" Printing & Publishing House, opened the event by briefly presenting an overview of the book’s main points.
“Author Chris Bohjalian has been touring throughout Canada and the United States to present his book, which in the past five months has sold 275,000 copies,” said Havatian. He added that the book, which was published in July 2012, is the fruit of the author’s thorough research, as well as the supportive input of Khachig Mouradian, the editor-in-chief of The Armenian Weekly and a former editor of Aztag Daily.
Havatian also thanked all those who contributed to the success of this event, especially Catholicos Aram I, the guest speakers, and the performing artists.
Afterwards, Dr. Arda Ekmekji, Dean of Arts and Sciences at Haigazian University, took the stage. In her speech in English, she praised Chris Bohjalian’s literary merit, noting that his novels have been translated into more than 25 languages, and three of them have been made into movies.
Dr. Ekmekji said that The Sandcastle Girls might seem like a fiction story to non-Armenians, “but to us, Armenians, each of its characters and scenes are closely related to and symbolize the Armenian Genocide.”
“The first post-Genocide generation remained silent and carried their dire memories to their grave,” added Dr. Ekmekji. “The second generation of survivors was also silent, while the young generation was interested in finding out about the fate of their ancestors.
The third generation tried to find evidences that would tell about the horrors of those memories.
The fourth generation revealed details about the historical facts by examining memoires and archives.
Thus, The Sandcastle Girls was filmed in New York, while the screening of The Forty Days of Musa Dagh was prohibited.”
The next guest speaker was prominent Lebanese writer and academician Michel Maaiki, who highly praised Bohjalian’s book.
In his speech in Arabic, Maaiki said that the book represents the collective conscience of the Genocide-stricken Armenian people.
“The lines in this book reflect the traces of the Genocide that was launched by Sultan Abdul Hamid and continued by his successors,” said Maaiki, adding that “Turkey tried to eliminate the Armenian nation, perceiving it as an obstacle to building its pan-Turanic empire.”
The same Turkey made an attempt to silence voices crying for freedom in 1916, in Beirut.
Maaiki also said that great works of literature and art have been born from the terrors of genocides, thus providing a brief comparative review of E. Hemingway’s novel For Whom the Bell Tolls and P. Picasso’s painting “Guernica,” which were inspired by the Spanish Civil War.
With regard to the latter work, when the Ambassador of Germany asks Picasso whether he was the painter of that artwork, Picasso replies: “No, you made that!”
On this occasion, Maaiki also made a reference to the tragic death of the Armenian poet Yeghishe Charents.
Afterwards, Chris Bohjalian took the stage and said “Thank you” in Armenian for this opportunity.
Talking about his Armenian and non-Armenian family roots, Bohjalian reminisced about his childhood — how every Saturday his Swedish mother used to take him to the house of his deceased father’s parents. These visits to the Bohjalians’ home had deeply impressed him.
Bohjalian thanked the organizers of this event, as well as Catholicos Aram I.
He also expressed his gratitude to Khachig Mouradian for greatly assisting with the publication of the book.
Bohjalian also mentioned the places he had visited while preparing the book, including Anjar, the orphanage established by Maria Jacobsen (where 3,600 Armenian orphans were cared for), and Yerevan.
Toward the end of the event, Catholicos Aram I addressed the audience in English and specifically highlighted the love and the message conveyed by the book.
“By writing this book, Chris Bohjalian did not narrate its events, but lived them,” emphasized the Catholicos.
“This book is a quest penetrating into his true roots,” said the Catholicos.
“It offers proof of the Armenian Genocide, which was systematically planned and executed by the Turkish government. Those who organized and participated in the perpetration of the Genocide should be held accountable.” He added that the Armenian Catholicosate of Cilicia in Antelias, which had given shelter to orphans back then, today stands as a symbol of struggle against the Genocide.
At the end, Catholicos Aram I awarded the Mesrob Mashdots Medal to Chris Bohjalian.
Afterwards, the Jenderejian brothers gave a violin performance, after which Chris Bohjalian signed copies of his book.

Children’s Story Hour Takes Place in Canada
The Hamazkayin Sanahin Chapter in Montreal on February 15, 2019, held a children’s story hour under the banner, “Books Are Our Friends, Fables Are Our Imagination.”
The story hour deputy leader, Meghrig Dzeytunian, read Hovhannes Tumanyan’s “The Talking Fish,” transporting the children into the world of Tumanyan’s imagination, where animals are able to communicate with words.
All of Tumanyan’s stories have a moral.
When the man catches a beautiful fish, the fish speaks to him and asks him not to cause any harm, for the fish’s family will miss it.
The man complies, and many years later the fish comes to save the man in a perilous time.
When the story was over, the children sat at tables and used their imaginations to color drawings of the fish.
Parents, prepare to enjoy a performance of the story of the little fish in your homes!
We impatiently await the children at our next story hour, which will take place on March 15 from 6 to 7 p.m. We will be reading The Little Prince.
We eagerly await the attendance of your children and grandchildren, and encourage them to come join us. Please contact Meghrig at 514-826-1075 or megho7@hotmail.com with questions.

Then, they made their first attempt to create a fairy tale.
After choosing a title for their story, each child started to draw it on the colorful pages of the booklet.
The children presented their imaginary scenes and feelings on the small colorful pages, thus conveying their creative spirit in a very special way.
Then, each of them took their place on the rug, following Harut Guloyan’s story about Chris, the angel of rain, who could bring the rain down from the clouds, entirely fulfilling the task entrusted to him.
After listening to the story about the angel’s experiences, the children answered the narrator’s questions.

Church service dedicated to the memory of the Benefactors of Galstaun Djemaran (Australia)
Organized by the Regional Committee of Hamazkayin in Australia, a devotional service dedicated to the memory of the deceased benefactors of the Galstaun Djemaran of Hamazkayin took place on Wednesday, February 22, 2012, at the memorial in Djemaran dedicated to the benefactors.
Following the religious service, 6th grade students placed flowers on the memorial. Afterward, the attendees entered Nalbandian Hall, where Assadour Shougayian, the head teacher of Armenian classes, welcomed the audience and invited Heros Krikorian, the chairperson of the Regional Committee of Hamazkayin, to speak.
Heros Krikorian began by informing the audience that the Regional Committee of Hamazkayin had decided to honor the memory of its benefactors, Arshak and Sophie Galstaun every year in February, the month of the birth of Arshak Galstaun and the death of Sophie Galstaun, with the aim of keeping their memory alive in the hearts of Djemaran students and the Armenian community.
“All our benefactors deserve great respect: some of them have supported Djemaran financially, and others, morally, because they have believed that the new generation, that is you, the students, should grow as Armenians. And that is best achieved in schools like this one.”
Assadour Shougayian first gave praise to this concept to honor the memory of benefactors. Then, mentioning the names of Arshak and Sophie Galstaun, Silva Chaprazian, Sarkis Pailagian, and Arthur Panigian, he praised their dedication and sacrifice, their vision and the deep faith and passion they had for that vision.
Mr. Shougayian emphasized that without their benevolence, the community would not have had its largest Armenian daily school that is a necessity to any national community living outside its fatherland.
He encouraged the students to become worthy inheritors of the legacy of the beneficiaries and with their diligence and Armenian spirit preserve that precious wealth.
A film prepared for the 25th anniversary of Djemaran was presented during the event. It featured events and memorable episodes from the history of the school with the participation of benefactors of Djemaran.
Towards the end of the event Caroline Blunden, the dean of Djemaran, took the stage. She offered her own praise for the immense work carried out by the Djemaran benefactors.
Father Norair Patanian delivered his message to the students and concluded the event with prayer.
May the memory of all the deceased benefactors, who had a vision and a goal, and who made sacrifices and were dedicated to realize their passion, stay alight in our souls and hearts.
It is thanks to these humble and good people that today we are enjoying the beautiful reality of having an Armenian daily school, at the same time believing that each and every Armenian should support this institution, since the legacy has been left not only to a small community, but to the entire Armenian community in Sydney.

Church service in memory of deceased Hamazkayin members (Australia)
At the initiative of the Regional Committee of Hamazkayin in Australia, a memorial service for the repose of the souls of all deceased Hamazkayin members was held on Sunday, March 17, 2013 at the Armenian Apostolic Church of Holy Resurrection in Sydney.
Given the fact that this year Hamazkayin celebrates its 85th anniversary, as well as the 50th anniversary of its chapters in Australia, the Regional Committee decided to launch the series of events in celebration of both occasions with a memorial service.
After the church service, the attendees headed to the hall of the Armenian Cultural Center for a coffee reception.
After the blessing of the gathering by Reverend Father Avetis Hambardzumyan, Ms. Seta Hovagimian, a member of the Regional Committee of Hamazkayin, explained the purpose of this memorial service and the types of events to be organized throughout this year. She invited Mr. Asadour Shougayan to convey his message to the audience.
Mr. Shougayan opened his speech by commemorating the founding fathers of Hamazkayin. He said that their memory is permanently present in our souls and inspires us in our work.
He described them as a remarkable, well-experienced and visionary generation that set the foundation of the First Republic of Armenia.
They served as the Prime Minister or ministers in the government of the Republic of Armenia, as members of the Parliament, or as members of commissions representing Armenia on the international stage. After being forced to leave Armenia (after its Sovietization), they were very well aware that the existence of an organization like Hamazkayin was vital for successfully preserving the Armenian identity in the diaspora in the long run.
The speaker attributed our existence as an organized community to the ideas and the hard work of that generation.
Mr. Shougayan then talked about the deceased Hamazkayin members who had been active in Australia. Upon setting foot in the continent, they founded Hamazkayin in 1963 — some of them even before organizing their personal lives — and immediately afterwards they created its adjacent institutions, such as a choir, dance troupe, theater group, other art clubs, weekly and daily Armenian schools, which were all important in preserving Armenian national identity.
Shougayan concluded his speech as follows: “If we could call the founding fathers of Hamazkayin heroes, for they had done great deeds to preserve the identity of our people, then I would like to call the members of Hamazkayin in Australia humble heroes, who were able to bring to life the vision and ideas of the founders.
Hence, let us pay our respects to the memory of our heroes and humble heroes.”
The event was concluded with a prayer. The attendees left the hall with their vows renewed and the determination to carry on the mission of Armenian identity preservation.

Commemorating the 140th anniversary of Bedros Tourian’s death (Australia)
An evening commemorating the 140th anniversary of Armenian poet Bedros Tourian’s death attracted a huge audience on Sunday, November 11, 2012, at 6:00 p.m., at the Nalbandian Hall of the Hamazkayin A. and S. Galstaun College, in Ingleside, Australia.
Arman Narinli delivered the opening speech. “A deep analysis of Bedros Tourian’s work — that is, an examination of the ideological sources and influences of his time period — requires specialization in literature.
It is necessary to take a look at the principles adopted by the French Revolution, and interpret the political meaning of the terms Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.
Bedros Tourian is one of the leading Romantic poets, whose poems are full of personal emotions and expressions of his inner world, as well as unparalleled outbursts against death,” said Narinli.
Toward the end of his speech, Narinli read a whole poem by Tourian that touched upon the themes of patriotism and national values.
Afterwards, Gayane Mouradian presented Bedros Tourian’s biography and works. Despite her very young age, she carried out the task flawlessly and recited another poem by Tourian.
Next, an artistic performance was presented featuring Kevork Mouradian on the saxophone and Lilit Mouradian on the piano. Then, Catherina Eozbegian performed a solo dance, Shahan Soghomonian played the cello, and violinist Christine Purzekian performed “Yerevan Erepouni,” accompanied by Dr. Marc Cholakian on the piano.
The highlight of the evening was a solo performance by singer Zvart Smsarian, who performed “The Pond” (“Ljag”), one of Tourian’s renowned poems.
Finally, in the last part of the artistic program, Sarin Zeitounian recited “My Death” (“Im Mahe”), another poem by Tourian, followed by the reading of the poem “The Child to the Cross” (“Manugn Arr Khach”) by Krikor Manoogian.
Afterwards, a play was performed, based on Arshag Chobanian’s article “Bedros Tourian’s Death” and staged by Azniv Ingilizian. The chief performer was Raffi Avedian.
The teenage performers presented a genuine portrayal of Tourian’s tragic last minutes before his death.
On behalf of the Regional Committee of Hamazkayin in Australia, Arshalouys Tahmizian spoke next, highly praising this second high-quality event organized by the Literary Committee, and thanking and congratulating all those involved.
The audience left the event venue with deep emotions and in high mood, wishing the Committee all the best.
Wake up Nightingale of Sgudar (Tourian) and see how a generation of young Armenians today has inhaled the beams of your poetry — a new generation who always strives to further solidify their Armenian identity and throughout their entire life will shine with Bedros Tourian’s spiritual brightness.

Commemorating the Genocide with an evening of art performances (Lebanon)
With the organization of the Central Association of the 100th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide in Lebanon and organized by the Regional Committee of Hamazkayin in Lebanon, an evening of art performances commemorating the Genocide was held on Tuesday, April 24, 2012, at 8:00 PM at the Hagop Der Melkonian Theater. The evening was titled “We shall struggle to the last drop…”
Following the national anthems of Lebanon and Armenia, Hagop Handian welcomed the audience on behalf of the Regional Committee of Hamazkayin.
He said the Turks failed to annihilate the Armenian people, to leave only one Armenian in a museum was their intent, and to erase Armenia from the world map. And today, 97 years later, Turkey is worried and has reason to because instead of erasing Armenia the country faces spiritual Armenias scattered around the globe.
Mr. Handian emphasized that Turkey is unaware of Armenians’ inner energy, and that our nation is capable of building houses, churches, schools, cultural centers, and clubs from the ashes.
“Our demand is based on the universal standards of justice and rights, and it can have only one outcome, which is success,” said Hagop Handian.
Speaking of the efforts of Armenians in preserving the national culture, Mr. Handian said that we, the Armenians, have been able to develop communities, preserve the national identity and remain true to our cultural values.
Consequently, Mr. Handian made a call to carry out through the struggle for the Armenian Cause, since the language of culture is comprehensible to all nations.
Mr. Handian added that it is a tradition for Hamazkayin to commemorate April 24 through art and culture and to raise our demands through various expressions of art.
He concluded his speech by saying: “Let us make art and culture the everyday axis of our everyday life, let us be armed with art and grow in strength for conquering our rights.”
Following the opening speech, art schools of Hamazkayin took the stage.
Aik Choir, conducted by Zakar Keshishian, performed the songs “Ave Maria,” “Kedashen,” and “Abril grgin” (“Live again.”)
Serouj Hovsepian, a member of Arek Theater, recited “Dle Yaman,” staged by Robert Arakelyan.
The Chamber Music Orchestra of Parsegh Ganachian Music College performed a set of musical compositions conducted by Garo Avessian.
Palig Ladoyian and Hrag Demirjian performed “Nocturne” by Baghdassarian respectively on the piano and on the violin.
Sarkis Hallajian played “Vagharshabadi bare” (“The Vagharshabad dance”) on the piano.
Sako Yakoubian, a student of the Arek Theater, recited “Vokin Abrilian” (“The April spirit,”) a poem by Jaques S. Hagopian.
The guitar ensemble of Parsegh Ganachian Music College, conducted by Mgrdich Mikayelian, performed “Zartir Lao,” (“Wake up, kiddo,”) “Ariounod trosh” (“Blood covered flag,”) and “Artiok ovker en” (“Who might they be.”)

The commemorative ceremony organized by the Literary Committee of Hamazkayin "Gladzor" Chapter took place on Sunday, February 28, 2016, at the Armenian Center of Toronto.

Snabian was enchanted by Mashtots, and his source of inspiration was Hakob Oshakan. The land of Armenia, its language and people were the most sacred treasures for Poghos Snabian. The impartial, inexorable and true intellectual did literary, educational, critical and editorial titanic work for more than six decades. Tamar Donabedian Guzuean also spoke about the tight connections between the author and the Armenian community of Toronto.
Then, Tamar Donabedian Guzuean invited to the stage the ARS school’s seventh grade student and recitation contest winner Lori Aramian, which has recently resettled in Toronto from Aleppo. She perfectly recited Rosa Bedrossian’s poem "Map".
Then, Tamar Donabedian Guzuean read Poghos Snabian’s writing "The Last Saint". The writer had dedicated it to the 100th birth anniversary of the genius composer Gomidas. After that, cellist Lusine Amirkhanyan from Yerevan Conservatoire masterly performed the composer’s classical pieces such as "Kele" and "Eli yerkinkn ampela".

Communique
Three years ago, the Central Executive Board of Hamazkayin began the development and distribution of “Lalan u Aran” (Lala and Ara) a series of Armenian-language electronic games for children and teenagers.
The primary purpose of the series is to make Western and Eastern Armenian instruction easier, more pleasant, and above all, more accessible to all, using everyday electronic devices.
After the great success of “Kuyneru Ashkharh” (The world of colors) and “Tseveru Ashkharh” (The world of shapes) in the “Lalan u Aran” series, a third game has now been released. “Kireru ashkharh” (The world of letters) is available for free download for phones and tablets on the iOS and Android platforms.
The game “Kireru ashkharh” familiarizes the Armenian child with the 38 letters of the Armenian alphabet in their lower-case and capital forms. For each letter there are colorful and sound-enhanced games, images, and activities.
This work would have been difficult to complete without the financial support of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation Armenian Communities Department and the Hamazkayin U.S.A. Eastern Region Executive Board. They have our profound thanks.
The “Lalan u Aran” series, which contributes to the spiritual and intellectual development of the Armenian child and especially makes Armenian a living language for play, is periodically refreshed with new games.
The variety of related merchandise—Armenian dolls and stationery—also continue to grow.
As we conclude our celebration of the 90th anniversary of the Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society, and as we approach the holiday season, “Kireru Ashkharh” in the “Lalan u Aran” series is our gift to the Armenian child.

Communiqué on the School Curriculum Prepared by Armenia’s Ministry of Education
For months, the whole world has been plunged in a deep crisis. Armenian society worldwide has had an additional challenge: Middle Eastern Armenian communities have been struggling to survive, and other communities have been mobilized to support them.
The coronavirus pandemic is destroying lives while also exacerbating economic crises.
While our homeland, Armenia, has been shaken by the coronavirus, its government has undertaken an initiative that may, in the long run, be an even greater cause for concern than a pandemic, which, thanks to human ingenuity, ultimately will be brought under control.
About a month ago, the Republic of Armenia published its new National Security Strategy. In this document, there are only passing references to culture and education. In the prime minister’s announcement, they are grouped under the headings “National Values” and “National Goals.” They are mentioned, but it seems there’s little to be done about them.
The 2007 version of the document, by contrast, had a lot to say about national identity, education and culture, and the maintenance of Armenian identity.
In short, the new strategy significantly shortchanges those areas.
Nine months ago, a plan was announced to remove the requirement for Armenian language and history classes from university curricula; this plan was adopted in spite of strong opposition.
For the duration of the debate, the minister in charge was notably disrespectful toward critics of the plan.
Now it’s the turn for public schools to have their curricula reformed, modernized, and adopted to the demands of the present. This is a process that any society goes through periodically, but meticulously and without panic.
A few days ago, the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture, and Sports presented the curricula for “Armenian History,” “World History,” “Armenian Language,” and “Literature.”
In modernizing educational programs, pedagogical and methodological questions and the selection of authors and texts are specialized matters about which the general public doesn’t have much to say. In this case, however, the identity of the individuals determining the curriculum and the contents of textbooks, along with their choices of topics and texts, show the questionable purposes of the changes. This is especially so since their strategy was not defined and explained up front.
There are serious reservations around the Armenian History, Armenian Language, and Literature curricula, which endanger an education that reinforces a national upbringing.
The director of the Institute of History of the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia, Professor Ashot Melkonyan, is preparing to ask the National Security Service to examine the issue.
The same alarm has been raised by the holder of the History of Armenia Chair at the Faculty of History of Yerevan State University, Professor Artak Movsisyan.
Both professors note that the curricula and approaches are taken from “History Education in Schools in Turkey and Armenia։ A Critique and Alternatives,” a publication that purports to provide detailed guidance to authors of history textbooks in Armenia and Turkey.
The participants in this joint Armenian-Turkish publication are the individuals entrusted with developing the Armenian history curriculum for Armenia.
The Philology Department of Yerevan State University has issued a communiqué about the Armenian Language and Literature curricula. The academic council of the department provides a rationale for its deep concern about, lack of confidence in, and rejection of the program, “State Curricula for Public Education.”
In this context, we are seriously concerned about the cursory attention given in the curricula to diaspora Armenian literature.
Diaspora Armenian literature is an enormous part of the Armenian literary heritage. It also has a critical role in fostering a connection between Armenia and Armenian communities worldwide.
We conclude from this process that the educational realm is being taken advantage of to improve, in the long term, Armenian-Turkish relations without the recognition of the Armenian Genocide and reparations.
In its time, similar efforts by the Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission (TARC) were defeated through the wakefulness of Armenians. Later, the so-called soccer diplomacy initiated in 2008 suffered a similar inglorious defeat in 2018.
The new curricula in Armenian history, Armenian language, and literature aim to serve the same purpose over the years. As such, they are to be rejected absolutely.
Since the fiftieth anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, Armenians have struggled for its international recognition.
We now live in the next stage.
We have come a long way.
It is not time to stop, especially as Armenians face many challenges.
We believe that Armenian history textbooks should be based exclusively on reality and truth, without consideration for the wishes and interests of any outside power or circle.
Armenian education should have only an Armenian orientation, a national orientation.
That is the only way an Armenian civic education will serve the development of Armenia and Armenian culture.
We expect that the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture, and Sports of the Republic of Armenia will reconsider the curricula it published for public comment and take care that its core revolve around national values, the national and cultural components that characterize the Armenian people, and the unity of diaspora and Armenia. This draft should be examined by experts; the issues they raise, and the corrections they recommend should be incorporated in it.
We believe that this is the only way to guarantee the development of the national character and identity of future generations—which are more than essential for a nation like ours that has been able to survive and thrive by maintaining its language and culture.
Finally, we hereby announce our willingness to participate in their process, with the goal of resolving the issues raised here.

Taking into account the organized various events in the community, our Board, in cooperation with the Board of "Sanahin" Chapter of Hamazkayin Montreal, declared 15 May of 2016 as the most suitable date for our celebration.
The celebration began with Djemaran's anthem, after which Djemaran Alumni Board Member Serzh Yesayan delivered the opening speech.
He spoke about the foundation of Djemaran, its activities and mission as a sanctuary of the Armenian language and culture. He also emphasised the importance of education saying, "Education, not only has financial benefits, but also is a great boon for any person, as it lits light in the person’s mental world, defeats ignorance and develops the person’s mind, feelings, imagination and soul.
Therefore, Djemaran is considered as the torch bearer of Armenian schooling."
Chairperson of Hamazkayin Montreal "Sanahin" Chapter, Tamar Poladian made a speech saying that "Sanahin" Chapter always supports Djemaran.
Then, the representative of Hamazkayin Canada Region, Viken Tufenkjian conveyed the Hamazkayin Central Committee’s message addressed to the graduates.
He began his speech with Nicole Aghpalian’s words "We are surrounded by terrible and destructive forces.
Therefore, it is necessary to create new and fanatical Armenians able to face the forces that invade from all sides to elliminate Armenians."
Tufenkjian referred to the history of Djemaran’s foundation and added, "During all 85 years, Djemaran gave birth to a new quality of Armenians called Djemaranagans, which have unique features. In fact, when we say Djemaranagan we mean a special image of Armenian.
So is in your case, dear graduates. Whenever you meet different generations of Djemaranagans, even unknown ones, you can immediately recognize the Armenian having the same education, ideals and dreams."
After Viken Tufenkjian’s speech, dinner was served.
It was followed by Djemaran’s Principal Dikran Jinbashian’s video-speech addressed to the Djemaran graduates in Montreal, after which the graduates of 1943 –1966 received certificates.

Dr. Ohan Tabakian’s Memoirs on Aleppo and Medicine Launched in Canada
On May 16, 2019, Armen Garo & Chaké Gunjian Centre in at the Armenian Community Centre of Montreal, a book launch was held. Dr. Ohan Tabakian’s two books, Husher yev Abrumner Yerazayin Haleben (Memories and Episodes from Dreamy Aleppo) and Pzhishgin Gyanken Abrvadz Baher (Moments from the Life of a Physician), were the focus of the event, organized by the Hamazkayin Montreal “Sanahin” Chapter Executive Board. Archbishop Suren Kataroyan, vicar of the Armenian Prelacy of Canada, was among the guests.
Nanor Ashna Sinabian-Libarian welcomed the guests. While people might think the author was born in Aleppo, where he spent his childhood and early teens, Ms. Sinabian-Libarian said, he was in fact born in Damascus.
She then read two poems titled “Birthplace.” The first was by Vahakn Davtian; the second, by Hamo Sahyan.
Sona Titizian-Gedigian presented the volume, Husher yev Abrumner Yerazayin Haleben. Reading the occasional excerpt, she described the content of the volume.
“Besides the personal memories, the book also serves as documentation.
It paints an almost comprehensive picture of life in Aleppo, the way of life, mores, and traditions, the feel of the place, the mindset, the behavior, the psychology. The author observes his environment, people, neighbors, friends from the neighborhood and school, their games, their adventures, their memories,” she said.
Reflecting on the author’s language and tone, Ms. Titizian-Gedigian said, “The writing is expository. The thoughts and feelings are open. There is no showing off in the structure of the sentences.
The author has remembered and put his memories into familiar words, on paper, without gilding them.”
Archbishop Kataroyan spoke. Dr. Tabakian had dedicating the volume to him, and the archbishop thanked him for that. He lauded the author’s way of seeing and describing people and events.
The second book, Pzhishgin Gyanken Abrvadz Baher, was discussed by Vicken Aprahamian, editor of the Armenian-language Horizon Literary Supplement.
After describing the content of the book, Mr. Aprahamian said, “What picture of our lives will generations coming of age in a few decades have?
There are minutes of meetings and reports, often more elaborate than those of a century ago; we have plenty of news stories in the pages of the press.
These documents are missing a fundamental quality, however: the human factor.
They are skeletons.
Memoirs are the meat on those bones, and they will provide, for our descendants, a full image of the past.
For a breathing and living image, memoirs are irreplaceable.”
Dr. Ohan Tabakian said words of thanks after which Ms. Sinabian-Libarian announced that the author was donating all the proceeds from the book to Hamazkayin.

Element Band in Toronto (Canada)
February 9, 2013 - The Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society “Klatsor” chapter executive and its “Two Masks” committee were proud to present “A Musical Evening with Element Band” to over 230 attendees, at the ACC’s main hall.
By special invitation, the Element Band, led by its talented director Ara Dabandjian, travelled to Toronto from Los Angeles, CA.
Having already established a strong following in North America, Element Band is comprised of young musicians who bring their own unique creative influence to many of our most loved traditional Armenian melodies.
The event was presented in a format that was unlike anything this community had seen before.
The music was paired with a selection of wines, and the culinary creations of our community’s own dedicated young chef Sebouh Yacoubian.
The tables and seating was arranged as it would be in a dinner-theatre or comedy club.
The stage was centrally set, so every seat had a close view of the musicians, while being able to interact with their tablemates.
Ara Dabandjian guided the attendees through each song, providing the background in the songs meaning, interpretation, and musical inspiration.
Despite the absence of a dance floor, many of the songs sparked impromptu dancing in between rows of seats and in the open spaces at the corners of the hall.

End-of year celebrations of M. and H. Arslanian Djemaran of Hamazkayin
At the end of the 2010-2011 academic year, the Dr. Adrineh Karakashian Hall of Hamazkayin was the meeting place for parents, graduating students, friends of the school, school staff and teachers, the directorship, the board of trustees, as well as the Central Committee of Hamazkayin.
Four end-of-year celebrations were held there. They were not only events for handing out certificates, but also occasions for displaying the knowledge and the work of students in various spheres of art.
The end-of-year celebrations event of the Norsigian kindergarten took place June 4.
The Pre-school and elementary school celebrations took place on Friday June 10, and Wednesday, June 15, 2011, respectively.
The students of the first three grades of the school performed a musical entitled, “The fox without a tail,” while the students of grades 4, 5, and 6 performed a theatrical concert entitled, “Birthday,” under the surveillance of Robert Arakelyan, the author and director of the play.

The event began with a video film illustrating photos of the graduating students from various school occasions throughout the years.
After hearing the national anthems of Lebanon and Armenia, Sebouh Torigian read a farewell speech on behalf of the students of the 11th grade. He said: “In this school students are divided not only into classrooms, but also into work groups where there is a warm atmosphere and mutual trust. Together, they organize successful events and prepare us for our national and human responsibilities.
Thus, in the auditorium, we have groups that develop the extracurricular interests of the students: collective lectures organized outside the groups prepare the responsible human being and the Armenian.
Apart from this, there are several other initiatives that bond all the students, such as an annual picnic, cultural day, and environment day, to mention some.
All these educational activities create a warm bondage between the students, as well as with the teachers, and it becomes hard to part from this family.
True, each graduating student will take his or her own road in life, but I am certain that they will never forget Djemaran which welcomed them, educated them, and cultivated their minds.
This is not their last day in Djemaran: this is simply a farewell, just a farewell.”
Following the farewell speech, Palig Aroyian from the graduating class performed a series of Armenian songs. Ani and Garin Arakelian from the graduating class recited “The Prelude” by Zareh Khrakhouni.
On behalf of the graduating class, Nanor Haroutyounyan read a speech.
She said: “Today we are living a very different emotion, since it is hard to complete one’s education in Djemaran, and yet stay a member of Djemaran, since even in the coming years we shall be obliged to live and act with the responsibility of a member of Djemaran.
Djemaran provided us not only with an education, and not only educated us as individuals and Armenians, but also induced in us the feeling of responsibility.
We are responsible for the higher education we are about to commence, our future results, as well as of the tasks we will be undertaking.
We are even responsible for our daily conduct, simply because we are members of Djemaran.
We are completing the course of the school where the spirits of Levon Shant and Aghpalian, Simon Vratsian and Karnig Guzalian prevail.
It is the school that made every effort so that we might have an unbreakable Armenian identity.
The future will show how we will be repaying what we have taken from Djemaran.
One thing is certain; that Djemaran has armed us with the weapons of the 21st century, for which we remain grateful both to Djemaran with its teachers and staff and to our parents who have sent us to Djemaran by undertaking great sacrifices.
We extend our heartfelt word of thankfulness to the principal of Djemaran, our teachers and all staff members.
It is with deep emotions that we pass the torch to the 11th grade, well knowing that this torch will stay alight and lead worthy generations.”
Following those farewell words, graduating students Nareh Salorian and Varanta Yakoubian sang “Zartir vortiag” (“Wake up, Son,”) while Lori Aprahamian and Hrag Karakashian accompanied on the guitar. Hrag Karakashian also performed “Zinvori yerk” (“Soldier’s song.”)

He said: “The presence of a youth armed with knowledge, is conscious of its responsibilities, aim at their best in their personal lives and put their intellectual and spiritual capacities to the service of the Armenian nation is very empirical in our reality.
With their message, our graduating students promise that time will show to what extent they will return to the Armenian people all that they have received at Djemaran.
Let us look forward to that and trust them.
And we wish a green path to the new Djemaranians, the graduating generation of 2011, who leave us physically but will stay in our minds and souls.

To address this pressing need, they established Hamazkayin. The core of the mission was to keep the Armenian people closely connected with their culture and homeland.
In the current situation, the need to maintain and develop our culture, especially in the context of globalization, which is consuming the new generation, puts us before new challenges.

Epic poem ″Daredevils of Sassoun″ Hamazkayin Book Club Forums (Canada)
"... God bless and have mercy on our David from Sassoun, the fist of our nation, our righteous and immortal David ...″
"... David put on his armour,
Tied his belt, and took his Tur Gedzagi (Sparkling Sword).
The cross on his arm,
He mounted his faithful steed Dzhalali
His Lion father's horse.... "
At my younger ages, the probability of being descended from the tribe of David of Sassoun greatly encouraged me.
In my childish imagination, the best of the epic heros David had made the impossible possible.
There is hardly anybody who hasn't read Toumanian's "David of Sassoun", hasn't heard about the Lion Mher or hasn't seen Yervand Kochar's wonderful statue to David of Sassoun in Yerevan without feeling of being proud.
However, what do we know beyond the fighting between David of Sassoun and Melik of Muser, or the epic poem ″Daredevils of Sassoun″ in general?
Here, opening some parenthesis, it is necessary to remember Prof. Arousyak Sahakian’s fascinating "Daredevils of Sassoun and Statehood Issue" presentation made a decade ago and organized by the Hamazkayin Gladzor Chapter. In her presentation, Arousyak Sahakian emphasized the relation of the epic poem to our nation and statehood.
In this regard, the Hamazkayin Book Club’s two-day Forum (23 November and 13 December 2016) took out from pages of history the main heroes and episodes, elucidated the characters and themes of the epic poem, the importance of water, dream and the promise, the hero’s character and virtues, the connection with the land and homeland, the place and role of "Have Mercy", the existing damnations and just the noticeable differences between the various stories and the common denominators thanks to Armine Torigian’s perfectly presented meticulous and lengthy research and her great narration ability.
Armine Torigian was born in Iran and got Armenian education, which automatically instilled love and interest in her towards the Armenian literature, although her university studies were in English literature.
She sings in the "Gousan" Choir and is a member of Hamazkayin Literary Committee of Gladzor Chapter.
Armine started the first section of the Forum explaining the audience that the heroic epic was first recorded in 1800s by Bishop Garegin Srvandztiants, and later, various versions existed based on narrations of various authors.
The epic poem, which had different titles, such as "Balds' Home", "Jojants Tun"(Patriarchs' Home), "Home of Sassoun" and others, consists of four cycles, the various versions of which (based on various narrations told by aged people of Sassoun) have certain distinctions. For example, Young (or Little) Mher, the son of David of Sassoun, does not exist in some narrations.
There are considerable differences in the use of dialects starting from Mokats dialect to the dialects of Sassoun and Mush.
The character of David of Sassoun, which appears in the third cycle, exists in all versions. So does the character of Uncle Toros. David's character sometimes differs from the one in our textbooks.
In narrations, young David was naive and kind, and only after a certain age and after fighting with Melik of Muser, we see the matured character of David. It is a character dear and familiar to all of us. David is a patriot, freedom-loving person, superhuman and at the same time very humane. He is the defender of human rights, the hero of Sassoun, the hero of Armenia, and a hero, which every freedom-loving Armenian bears deep in his heart.
Armine, during the two presentations, took us to the world of epic heroes starting from Tsovinar to Sanasar and Paghtasar, Marouta Mountain, Kourkig Jalali and Tur Gedzaki (Sparkling Sword), Uncle Toros, Dzenov Ohan, Lion Mher, Ismil Khatun, David, Pretty Gohar and Chmshgik Sultan, Armaghan and Little Mher to Sasoun’s Kaptakogh and Agravakar. Aren Mnatsaganian read extracts from the poem and impressed the audience. Armine Torigian opened new pages for us, awakened interest, and wishes to study the most prominent heroic epic about the Daredevils of Sassoun.
Armine's work really deserves appreciation. Let God have mercy on those who transmitted the priceless treasures of our culture, the epic poem of Daredevils of Sassoun to us, and on those who narrated it - our heroic fathers, and grandfathers.

On December 9, 2018, the Aram Manougian Club in Neos Kosmos, in Athens, was once again the site of joyous celebrations featuring Armenian song and dance.
The Hamazkayin Attica Sos-Vani Chapter Executive Board organized an event dedicated to the capital city of Armenian hearts and longing, Yerevan. According to Urartu-era stone inscriptions, the city is 2,800 years old. Archeological digs, however, show evidence of habitation from 6,000 years before the common era.
Members of the ARF Central Committee were present, as were representatives of the national executive council, Rev. Hrayr Nigolian, pastor of the St. Gregory the Illuminator Church, representatives of the Armenian Relief Society, Homenetmen, and Azat Or.
Jacques Damadian, chairperson of the chapter executive board, said, “In a few weeks, we will reach the end of a year that was full of anniversaries and emotions.
As lovers of culture, we mourned the loss of Charles Aznavour and [the Istanbul Armenian photographer] Ara Güler.
We celebrated the 90th anniversary of Hamazkayin.
As a nation, we celebrated the centennial of the first Armenian republic and the thirtieth anniversary of the Karabakh movement.
It has been 30 years since the massacre at Sumgait, in Azerbaijan, and since the earthquake in Spitak.
But the Armenian, again, like steel, was strengthened by the blows and again, sang and danced, created and, again, celebrated.
And now we celebrate Yerevan on its 2,800th birthday.”
Evening by Theatrical Unit of Hamazkayin
On June 3, the location of the event was Keush Ranch, thanks to which the success of the evening was almost guaranteed.
It was a place on the slopes of the Tujunga Mountains, surrounded by fields and forests. With all that beauty, the arranged tables and chairs, treated wine and various dishes created a pleasant atmosphere there.
Away from noisy city and close to the nature, a very nice evening was prepared where one could really enjoy the theater and musical performances.
The presence of a large number of young people was especially noticeable.
Hamazkayin was content with their presence because in nowadays it is hard to get the young people interested.
They rarely participate especially in classical events, such as lectures or presentations.
Theatrical Unit Board Chair Naris Terzian-Mraian delivered the opening speech.
The host of the event was Nairi Harpoyan-Momjian.
The participant actors, in the head of their director Vane Asaturyan, were invited to the stage.
They skillfully performed comic scenes and received appreciation from the audience.
Evening Dedicated to Armenian Education and “Nareg” School in Cyprus
Hamazkayin’s Nikosia “Oshagan” chapter held its regular culture-focused meeting on December 4, 2019. The focus was on Armenian education and the place of the Nareg school in the local and European educational system.
By way of opening the evening’s program, the Nicosia chapter’s president, Arto Tavitian, welcomed the presence of the pontifical vicar for the Armenian Diocese of Cyprus and the member of parliament for Armenians in Cyprus. He said the Nareg school was the community’s inner fortress, which needs to be enveloped in love and caring to maintain the community’s Armenian character.
The chairperson of the Board of Trustees of Armenian Schools in Cyprus, the longtime teacher and principal Vartan Tashjian, spoke about Armenian education, saying that Armenian schools and language are essential to maintaining Armenian identity.
He reflected on the difficulties faced by the diaspora, and the efforts that continue to be made to save our identity from perdition.
“There will always be disappointments, but there is no need to despair, we just must continue our fight,” he concluded.
The Nareg school principal, Vera Tahmazian, aided by a video, presented the school’s place in the Cyprus educational system, where it cooperates with other schools to organize joint programs and contests. Nareg students regularly shine in these settings with their store of knowledge and their audacity.
The same happens in Europewide programs. Our students are on a par with the students of exemplary schools in progressive European countries. In these settings, they present themselves as Armenian, not just representatives of Cyprus.
The teacher Nora Najarian shared some pieces of interesting news about Nareg students at a competition in Greece.
To end the evening, Arto Tavitian thanked everyone present, especially the presenters. He said that Hamazkayin, as a cultural and educational association, was glad to provide a forum for Nareg so the community could become more familiar with the work Nareg is doing, as well as their praiseworthy trustees, administrators, and teachers.
Evening Dedicated to Baruyr Sevag (Australia)
"How can one stand before Baruyr Sevag's grave disbelieving the immortality of soul.
Baruyr Sevag's birth became a real "Let there be light" for us, our culture, our present and future.
To this profound idea of the Catholicos we can only add that blessed is our homeland that has given birth to such genius sons and appreciates them.
The Armenian Community having a half-century history on the distant shores of Australia worthily venerated Baruyr Sevag as a poet on the 45th anniversary of his death.
It was a wonderful and unique event, during which the small number of readers praised the great Armenian poet Baruyr Sevag and stated that the great poets do not die. They emerge into the people's souls, penetrate into their hearts and live in them from generation to generation.
The Literary Committee of the Regional Executive Board of Hamazkayin could really pay tribute to Baruyr Sevag on Friday, 20 May 2016 at 7pm at the Armenian Cultural Hall, where the society of book lovers gathered around the round tables to venerate the greatest poet and philosopher.

Holy Father opened the event with blessings, after which Comrade Lilik delivered the opening speech in the name of the Committee. She briefly presented the description of the event, after which the program started.
In a warm and friendly atmosphere, each participant, either standing or sitting, presented his favorite piece from Baruyr Sevag.
First, Viken Galloghlian read his "Hello" conveying the message that loyalty and warmth should be inseminated in humanity.
Comrade Kortian read his favorite article about Baruyr Sevag and his birth.
Holy Father shared his memories, spoke about the poet and remembered how the book "The Incessant Bell Tower" was sold quickly, how it impressed the readers and how the Kevorkian seminary students read it by heart.
Sevag was the younger generation’s pure soul and heartthrob, protest, struggle, faith, and finally, the truth.
The accident took him away in the period when his creative forces flourished.
He became the singer of the national pain and joy and escorted his nation to immortality.
Archbishop concluded his speech reading Sevag’s poem "To live ... live ...".
The program continued by Comrade Shukayan that presented analysis on the stages of the Armenian literature, such as Revival, Realistic, Esthetic and the period of younger generation, the representative of which is Sevag.
He spoke also about the writer’s life and works, as well as his last masterpiece "Let there be light", which is the heir of the past and the messenger of future.
After Comrade Anush’s recitation of "Testament", the audience sang the song "Sardarapat", the lyrics of which was written by Sevag.
The recitations, speeches and toasts refreshed the feelings of the audience.
"Frankly speaking," "At once," "Under burden", "Go crazy", "My Armenian people," "The Life of Greats", "Armenian language", "I regret for a moment," "Excerpt from Triple Voiced Liturgy” and "We grow old, Baruyr Sevag".
Of course all of these poems have immortalized Baruyr Sevag and he has become a real idol for the members of this book-club.
Sevag sympathized the whole world with his word and the word became his mission and tragic fate.
Anna Chorekchian had prepared a very interesting corner of Sevag’s letters, which had been collected and published in the book entitled "Shulammita, great love of Sevag".
This two-volume book is the story of Sevag’s endless, deep and immense love.
At the end, Comrade Lilik made a brief speech about Sevag’s heroic participation in Artsakh movements.
There are very few poets, which could open new tracks in the Armenian literature.
The evening ended with Holy Father’s protecting prayer.
"We enjoyed it a lot and will be looking forward to the next one", said Holy Father in his farewell speech.
It was a superb evening, and the audience left the hall with high mood, appreciation and best wishes.
Good job, literary committee.

Evening with Writer, Literary Translator, Dr. Diana Hambardzumyan in Canada
"Doctor in Philology Diana Hambardzumyan, a professor of Linguistics from Yerevan State Linguistic University after V. Brusov, as well as a prose writer and literary translator, recently made a short-term visit to Val-David, Montreal where she had been invited to take part in the International "Writer-in Residence" Program.
Taking advantage of her visit, the Regional Executive Board of Hamazkayin Canada along with "Horizon Grakani" organized on July 23, in Montreal, an event focused on the current situation of the Armenian literature.
At the same time, the Regional Executive Board of Hamazkayin Canada organized the same event in Toronto.
It is quite a difficult task to organize an event in Toronto on Mondays even if it is a private literary soiree.
However, on July 28, 2014, at 8: 00 pm, about 60 writers and fans of literature, in the presence of Der Komitas Senior Priest Panossian, gathered in Armenian Center’s "Harutyun Manoogian" library to listen to Dr. Hambardzumyan.
Tamar Donabedian taking the floor on behalf of the Regional Executive Board of Hamazkayin Canada briefly introduced the guest and gave her to the audience.
Dr. Hambardzumyan expressed her gratitude to the Regional Executive Board of Hamazkayin Canada and spoke about her literary-creative activity and achievements.
Her father is from Kajaran City of Syunik Marz situated on the east slope of the Zangezur mountain range. Her mother is from Tiflis.
Her father used to write diaries, and the library occupied a special place in their house.
Actually, she has always lived in the world of books since her childhood and was very much interested in literature since then. She successfully completed her secondary education and graduated from Yerevan State Linguistic University with Honors Diploma. For more than 30 years, she has been teaching the English Language and Translation Skills there.
She is married, has two children and two grandchildren.
She started to write at a very young age, and, "Garun" and other magazines published her writings.
She has written more than fifty articles, specific textbooks and 18 books. Her most famous novelettes, novels and stories are "Milky way", "Across the Burnt Bridges" (on Armenian-Azeri relations), "Grief and Troubles since Time of Noah", "In the God-inhabited Country", "A Knock at the Door," etc.
Her novel “In the God-inhabited Country” won the prize of the "Armenians in the 21st Century" Contest.
She is also the author of numerous literary translations such as the novel by the famous American writer Kurt Vonnegut "Bluebeard".
She earned her PhD Degree in 1990 and the Doctor’s Degree in 2007. The first research was focused on the poetry of the famous English poet of the 19th century Percy Bysshe Shelly, and the second was on the linguo-stylistic analysis of William Faulkner’s works.
Her stories translated into 13 languages are included in the Armenian-English bilingual book "Top 10 Stories" translated by her former students. It is undoubtedly a great satisfaction for the author.
Since 2004, she has been a member of the Armenian Writers’ Association.
When we asked Dr. Hambardzumyan about her preferences between the life as a doctor professor and the life as a writer, her answer really surprised us.
She said, "Actually, writing is my life, and the professor’s work is what I do for living".
The axis of Diana Hambardzumyan’s works is the individual, the human being. As a writer, she has been greatly influenced by the Armenian and foreign literature and the life, with its vicissitudes.
The problems of today’s Armenia, troublesome economic situation, injustice, corruption and migration are the main issues touched upon in her novels and stories.
Speaking about the contemporary Armenian writers, Dr. Hambardzumyan expressed satisfaction to have enjoyed the presence of the great Armenian writers Levon Khechoyan and Hrant Matevosyan and the honor of being their contemporary.
She also spoke about the prose writer, translator Ruben Hovsepian and Gurgen Khanjyan whose famous novel "Hospital" has become a movie.
Any writer is satisfied only when her published books find their readers. She sincerely says, "I won´t write if I don’t have readers".
According to Diana Hambardzumyan, her writing style has changed over the years, which is natural. Nevertheless, the axis of her novels and stories remain the same human, beggar, soldier and the deprived of rights….
The troubled days of the nineties in Armenia certainly had great impact on all segments of the society.
Speaking about the new generation of writers, she said that at present there are talented young writers in Armenia who write about the subjects bothering them.Actually, the environment affects any artist.
She mentioned the names of the young writers such as Aram Pachyan (Bird), Hrach Saribekyan (The Sun of Twins), Ara Husik....
She said, "However, the writers need the government’s support.
Unfortunately, when at present a writer applies for a state support to publish his book, he receives only two copies of his published book in the end".
Referring to translation work, she, along with other names, recalled the names of Samvel Mkrtchyan and Lilit Galstyan.
It was interesting to hear about the "literary agency", the founder of which is her former disciple.
When a writer publishes a book, not only his immediate environment should recognize it. Such an agency seeks ways to make the people know about the book both in Armenia and abroad and thus lightens the burden on the writer’s shoulder.
Book publishing is one thing, but spreading a book is another thing.
In both cases, according to Hambardzumyan, the government should support the writers.
When they asked her why there was no word about the Armenian writers of diaspora in her speech she said she knew them well enough and could talk about it. However, the topic of the day was the situation of the Armenian literature in Armenia. Later she praised the Armenian poet Zahrat from Istanbul and recalled Jacob Khachikyan’s name.
This was Dr. Diana Hambardzumyan’s second participation in the International "Writer-in Residence" Program. Her first participation was in Vienna, where she stayed for two months in 2011.
In March 2015, she was invited to Munich, Germany where the book “Telegram to Fatima" translated by her into German was published.
Dr. Hambardzumyan completed her speech reading an extract from her novel "A Knock at the Door".
In the end, Tamar Donabedian presented Vazken-Shoushanian’s book "Turbulent Years" to her on behalf of the Regional Executive Board of Hamazkayin Canada. The book "Turbulent Years" has been the first edition of "Oshakan" bibliographic series edited by the Regional Executive Board of Hamazkayin Canada.
We can continually discuss issues concerning the situation of today’s Armenian literature, contemporary writers and writers of the past, environment impact on writers within their lifetime, criteria to evaluate the contemporary Armenian writers, changes made in the Armenian language, stylistic differences between the languages of prose and poetry. Nevertheless, translating the foreign literature into Armenian is certainly praiseworthy. What do we need to make the foreigners recognize the Armenian literature? How can we help the Armenian writers win the world awards?

With the initiative of “Hayoki” Publication Series and with the joint organization of Vahe Setian Publishing House of Hamazkayin, “Aztag” Daily, and “Hayoki” Publication Series, an event celebrating the Western-Armenian version of “Verk Hayasdani, voghp hayrenaseri” (“Wound of Armenia: lament of a patriot”) by Khachadour Apovian took place June 6, 2011, at 7:30 PM, at the Punig Hall of “Aztag” Daily.
Hagop Havatian delivered welcome the audience and said that after 12 years of interruption, the “Hayoki” Publication Series once again puts itself on the frontlines of the mission of spreading and enriching Armenian books and literature. This time the initiative has been the publication of the Western-Armenian version of “Verk Hayasdani” by Khachadour Apovian.
“Khajag Kalousdian, the initiator, founder, and person in charge of the “Hyeoki” publication series, reacting to the threat the Armenian language and culture faces from the retreat of reading, with a bold move decided to publish this book in 2500 paperback and hard cover copies,” Mr. Havatian said.
On this occasion and on behalf of the “Aztag Daily” and the Vahe Setian Publishing House of Hamazkayin, he expressed thorough appreciation to two deceased dedicated individuals, who have been members of the Hayoki” publication series board and made major contributions to the development of new Armenian generations. One of them is veteran pedagogue, educator, intellectual, and school director Manooshag Boyajian, and intellectual, publicist and intellectual activist Vazken Etiemezian.
Dr. Armenag Yeghiaian, the book editor and the translator of the book into Western Armenian, was the first keynote speaker. He presented the challenges he faced during his task.
He said that although the person and the works of Khachadour Apovian have been greatly admired by the Armenian people, it has been difficult to read his books because his language is not understood by modern Western Armenian readers.
Dr. Yeghiaian added that during the translation of the book around 2000 words have been interpreted. Some of those words come from the Armenian Golden Age and have changed their meaning throughout centuries to the extent that they are totally incomprehensible to the contemporary reader. Another section of words have been subjected to fewer changes in their meaning, yet they are still incomprehensible since they come from the dialects. The majority of the incomprehensible words are Turkish, while some of them are Persian.
Mr. Yeghiaian also talked about issues with grammar and expressions which now seem to be incomprehensible, because they were developed and used for a given community with its own mode of thinking and rules.
Concluding his speech, Mr. Yeghiaian called for encouraging reading especially among students, since it is during the school years that the bondage with books are forged and this has a significant role in the preservation of national identity.
Lastly, he thanked the initiators of this translation and everyone who contributed to the realization of this project.
Afterward, Heghnar Yeghiaian read excerpts of the “Verk Hayasdani, voghp hayrenaseri” (“Wound of Armenia: lament of a patriot”) in Western Armenian.
The second lecturer was literary specialist and art specialist Prof. Yervand Ter Khachatryan from Armenia, who emphasized the importance of making such a book accessible to the Western Armenian reader. He said this initiative is indeed historical, as is the event celebrating its publication.
He added that with this publication the reader will come in contact with one of the greatest Armenian figures, Khachadour Apovian, who with his life and fate is a symbol of the fate of the Armenian people and who has created a unique language to represent his own times and to make literature comprehensible and true to their hearts.
According to Prof. Ter Khachatryan, after completing this oeuvre, Khachadour Apovian said he achieved his ultimate goal: having put the foundations of a path that would continue in the Armenian literature.
The Professor said the book is not just a novel, but it contains very special meaning, value, and message, since it is all about the people and its life, it is comprehensible by all the social classes, and its heroes belong to the same society.
According to him, with “Verk Hayasdani, voghp hayrenaseri” (“Wound of Armenia: lament of a patriot,”) Khachadour Apovian has created a vibrant oeuvre, wrapping our past history and reaching the future.
The book was lit like a torch and until today it continues illuminating. Anyone associated with it is cleansed, and undergoes personal changes on completing the reading of the book. He also stated that this is the first complete publication of the book in Western Armenian.
Concluding his words, he offered his congratulations on the book’s publication.
After the conclusion of the event, Dr. Armenag Yeghiaian and Prof. Yervand Ter Khachatryan signed copies of the book.
Event Dedicated to Ongoing Artsakh Conflict Held in Damascus
On the evening of October 16, 2020, Hamazkayin’s Levon Shant chapter in Lebanon held an event with information about the current and ongoing conflict in Artsakh. It took place in the Aharonian center.
Present at this event were members of the Aharonian center board, representatives from sister organizations, and many Damascus-Armenians.
Board member Maral Kateklian welcomed everyone and asked those present to rise for a moment of silence to honor and remember the people who have heroically given their lives to protect the sovereignty of their land and to send prayers to those who continue in this ongoing struggle.
Event dedicated to the memory of intellectual, cultural and public figure Kevork (George) Apelian (Lebanon)
The Regional Committee of Hamazkayin in Lebanon and the Aztag Daily hosted an evening dedicated to the memory of the honorable intellectual, cultural, and public figure Kevork (George) Apelian on Monday, January 30, 2012, at the Punig Hall at Aztag Daily. Family members, representatives from Armenian national institutions, artists, and art lovers attended the event.
On behalf of the organizers Dr. Sebouh Manjian said Apelian was a man who had dreams and vision and who was a total Armenian with the most genuine sense of the word.
He emphasized that Kevork (George) Apelian was a teacher of ideas, faith and dedication, and was as bright and as warm as the light of modesty. He parted this world with his unfulfilled dreams, while in his lifetime was a lively example of life itself.
Following the presentation of a slide show depicting Kevork (George) Apelian life, Yessayi Havatian said Apelian reached success in several spheres.
Apelian was a teacher, journalist, writer, intellectual, member of community groups, and carried out party and church activities.
He added that Apelian had fully participated in organizing all events dedicated to the heroic fight of Moussa Ler.
Khachig Dedeyian spoke about Kevork (George) Apelian, the writer.
He said Apelian was a humorist who, with the pen name Tsiounagan, wrote sharp remarks and alarming notes about the despicable practices of our people.
Mr. Dedeyian added that Apelian’s heart throbbed with the crisis of the fatherland, its worries, and its daily life.
With his death, the Lebanese-Armenian press lost one of its authentic and brave writers who was at the forefront for more than 40 years and who was always true to his principles and ideas, and always believed in the educational role of the press.
He added that his story was the double martyrdom of Genocide survivors: a heartbreaking, horrible, yet true story.
Throughout the event, Zakar Keshishian and Datevig Artinian performed respectively on the shvi and the piano, while Irma Dedeyian read an excerpt from Kevork (George) Apelian’s writings.
Event dedicated to the memory of Kevork-George Apelian (Kessab)
Organized by the Hamo Ohanjanian Chapter of Hamazkayin in Kessab, an event dedicated to the memory of writer Kevork-George Apelian took place Sunday, February 5, 2012 at 12:00 PM at the Sahagian Hall. Among the audience were spiritual leaders of the Armenian Apostolic and Evangelical churches in Kessab, book lovers, and family members.
On behalf of the Committee of Hamo Ohanjanian Chapter of Hamazkayin in Kessab, Varteni Tanielian highlighted the motive and importance of organizing this event. She said the committee organized the event out of respect and appreciation for the work of Kevork-George Apelian and not to merely observe the fortieth day of his death, because Kevork-George Apelian dedicated his life to Armenian literature for half a century and left behind an example of stewardship of Armenian letters and literary works.
Following the opening speech, Meghri Apelian presented the life of Kevork-George Apelian, while corresponding excerpts from Apelian’s literature were projected on a screen.
Silvie Apelian-Jghelian, the teacher of Armenian classes at the Ousoumnasirats Armenian Intermediate School in Kessab, presented the writer and his work. Afterwards, Ani Apelian read an excerpt from the novel “Anna Harse” (“Anna the bride.”)
Afterward, there was an art program. Vana Tanielian, an 11th grade student at the Armenian Ousoumnasirats United Djemaran, recited “Hashvehartar,” (“Reckoning,”) by Vahan Tekeyian, and Garo Cherchigian performed “Verkerov li” (“Heavily wounded”) on the flute.
Nshan Basmajian was the last speaker and recognized the literary merit of George Apelian.
The harmonic communication between the stage and the audience throughout the event was eye catching.
Members of the Kessab community, who had not been able to attend Kevork-George Apelian’s funeral, through this event paid their respects (undoubtedly not the last) to the memory of their intellectual compatriot, who, even though he did not live in Kessab, had made Kessab and its people the topic of his literature.
The most important presence of the evening was that of Kevork-George Apelian: A spiritual presence that was good, simple, and genuine.
His large picture projected aont a screen throughout the event further accentuated that fact, while his books exhibited at the entrance of the hall were the proof of his writer’s undying merit.
The event was concluded with sbrief words of appreciation and a prayer from Father Muron Avedissian.

Event dedicated to the memory of Sarkis Giragossian (Lebanon)
On the occasion of the 40th Day after Death, the Hamazkayin Central Committee of Lebanon organized an event dedicated to the memory of Sarkis Giragossian. The event took place on Sunday, August 30th, immediately following his requiem service in the “Giligia” museum of the Catholicosate of Anthelias. Among those present were his family, relatives, friends, members of the community, as well as representatives of different organizations.
Irma Dedeyan gave the opening speech for the event.
She stated that this memorial gathering coincides with Sarkis Giragossian’s 40th Day after Death, and it assembles those who respected him, his ideas and his legacy. She continued by saying that with the passing of Sarkis Giragossian, the Lebanese Armenian community lost a great poet, a literary master, a cultivator of literature and culture, an editor and a keeper of the Armenian language, which he upheld with much conviction and devotion.
Sarkis Giragossian passed away too soon, leaving behind a great deal of projects and unfinished work. We are left with only his memory.
Irma Dedeyan affirmed that the Lebanese Armenian community will continue to embrace his legacy and memory with gratitude and respect.
After the opening remarks, Fr. Vahrij Gharakhanian recited poems from Sarkis Giragossian’s vast poetry collection.
The event continued with a performance of the song “Yerp Alegodz” interpreted by Avedis Akrabian, accompanied by Haroutioun Mgrditchian on the piano.
Event Dedicated to Writer Kevork-George Apelian Organized by the Hamazkayin”Gladzor” Chapter’s Book Club (Canada)
It is hard to believe that four years have passed since February 19, 2012, when Club Member Razmik Mnatsakanyan presented the works of Vahan Terian at the first gathering of the Club.
Very few were convinced then that those presentations would be continuous. Many people thought that today's young people are not interested in literature, do not understand the language, and that the ideas touched upon in our literature are generally not comprehensible to the young generation.
Of course, this may all be true, but it does not mean that we should not try or make efforts to create a bridge between the Armenian young generation and the Armenian literature if we really understand the importance of that goal.
After Terian, we presented H. Sahian, A. Aharonian, Siamanto A. Tsarukian, G. Emin, P. Durian, H. Tumanyan, H. Shiraz, V. Davtian, G. Zohrab, H. Baronian, Z. Yesayan, Z. Asatur, Jivani, V. Shushanian, D. Varuzhan, Reuben Zartarian... and many others. In those presentations, the number of which has reached to 35, our skillful youngsters also occasionally took part.
We held discussions upon many subjects, including the past, present and future of the Armenian language. The presentations included the Western and Eastern Armenian writers, as well as Diaspora writers.
The fifth year’s first gathering organized by the Literary Committee of the Hamazkayin "Gladzor" Chapter was dedicated to writer Kevork-George Apelian (1941-2011). It took place on Sunday, March 13, 2016 in the afternoon.
Apelian was originally from Kessab. Not surprisingly, the majority of the audience were descendants from Kessab and Musa Dagh. The writer's sister Anahit Apelian Toutikian was among the guests. She had arrived from Toronto to take part in the presentation.
ARS daily school graduate, Board member of the Hamazkayin Toronto Chapter, long-time member of Hamazkayin "Erebuni" Dance Ensemble, Rupina Sarkissian conducted the presentation.
Rupina has got her education at the University of Toronto, and in the nearest future she will also follow speech therapy. Her parents also come from Kessab.

Exhibit in Anjar Features Newly Deceased Artists
Works by the newly deceased Rev. Fr. Haroutiun Bezdikian, Dr. Arto Nakoulian, and Vrej Taslakian were exhibited on September 9, 2021, at the Movses Der Galustian Hall of the S. Zetlian People’s House in Anjar, Lebanon. At the initiative of the local ARF committee, the exhibit was organized by the local Hamazkayin chapter in cooperation with Anjar Art Gallery.
Nathalie Derstepanian Kendirjian welcomed guests on behalf of the chapter and the gallery and asked for a moment of silence in memory of the three artists who, like the residents of Anjar, hailed from Musa Ler.
She announced that on the occasion of the eightieth anniversary of the founding of Anjar, Gaidzag & Zovig Zeitlian had created and encouraged a welcoming space for artists with ancestry from Musa Ler to share their work with the Anjar public.
Ms. Kendirjian said the gallery was showing works by twenty artists.
Exhibit in San Francisco is a Success
The Arts Committee of the Hamazkayin San Francisco Nigol Aghpalian Chapter spent months preparing a first-of-its-kind exhibit.
“Journey Through Armenian Paintings 1800–2000.” What made the exhibit special was the projection of paintings onto the large screen by artists who lived and created over the 200 years covered by the program.
The exhibit was opened on November 16, 2019, at the Khachaturian Armenian Community Center.
An enthusiastic and large crowd was present for the opening.
The exhibit began with Vardges Sureniants’s “Ferdowsi reading the Shahname,” with its intricate Persian carpets. It featured Hakob Hovnatanyan’s beautiful portrayal of the sleeves of women’s costumes and the rings on their fingers. It included Haroutiun Galentz’s expressive portraits. The works of Armenian painters followed one after another.
The audience was moved by the encouraging words Martiros Saryan addressed to Minas Avetisyan when Avetisyan’s workshop burned down: “Minas, Now is the time to show everyone that you are stronger than anyone.
Don’t let your enemies think you are hopeless.”
He made a gift of paintbrushes to his young friend so he might resume painting.
The sisters Mariam and Eranuhi Aslamazyan, Lucy Tutunjian, and Jacqueline Ohanian—with their colorful fruits, flowers, and horses, once again demonstrated the delicate eye of Armenian women artists in observing their surroundings, and their inner strength in painting them with a characteristic emotiveness.
The list of artists shown is long. It also includes the Iranian-Armenian painters Smbat, H. Vardanian, M. Shabazian, and Y. Nahapetian.
The list was not comprehensive, and worthy artists were left out for the simple reason that young mother living in San Francisco had sought out their preferred artists and researched their work.
Eighteen young mothers had selected Ivan Aivazovsky, Arshile Gorky, Guvder, Jean Jansem, Paul Guiragossian, Shant Avetisian, Grigor Khanjyan, and others.
The hall was filled with Armenian music. Old and new friends met each other in an atmosphere filled with culture and high art, proud to be part of a people that gave birth to painters such as those on exhibit.
They left the hall happy and a bit more Armenian. 
The next day was for the young people in the community. After viewing the works of some artists, the children tried their hands at painting works in the tradition of Martiros Saryan or the Yerevan Children’s Art Museum.
Members of the chapter executive board and Arts Committee were thrilled to see the success of the program.
They had proved once again that planning together, working meticulously, and believing in the importance of the project they had initiated, it is possible to accomplish something difficult but valuable.

Exhibition of Sculptor Toros in UNESCO (Paris)
"I sculpt to express my feeling, which I cannot express by words.
Aesthetics and beauty are part of my work, but I keep my affliction with me.
Hope all of you will be impressed with my creations.
A book tells a story, so does the exhibition″, says Toros.
The opening ceremony of the four-day exhibition of 26 sculptures created by the renowned Armenian sculptor Toros Rastkelenian took place on November 28, at the Ségur Hall of UNESCO.
It was the artist’s first exhibition in this international cultural center. The title of the exhibition was La paix: Toros œuvre intégrale, organized in the framework of the protection and development of cultural values by UNESCO.
Alberto Giacometti’s prominent sculpture The Walking Man (l'Homme qui marche) was also exhibited in the same hall.
Toros was born in Aleppo, in 1934.
His roots are from Urfa city of Western Armenia.
His seven-meter statue Liberated Arab Woman, holding a torch in one hand, and the spikes of wheat in the other hand, is located on one of the Aleppo's squares.
One can see his works such as Simon Zavarian’s and Vahan Tekeyan’s busts, Abu Lala Mahari sculpture and others in different parts of Aleppo, where a great number of Armenians live.
In 1967, Toros settled in France, and now he lives in the city of Roman, where he creates in his huge art studio.
His brass and copper-carved monuments are situated in various districts of France - Marseille, Aix-en-Provence, Valence, Vienne, Saint Etienne, Roman and elsewhere, and also in Yerevan, where the bust of Sayat Nova is located on the same avenue. The artist has donated the portrait sculpture of Komitas to the Museum of the great composer in memory of Urfa's heroic battle.
I had arrived a bit earlier, and when I went inside the exhibition hall I saw the 84-year-old artist with gently smiling eyes.
Walking in the hall, I watched his very Armenian and at the same time very unique and exceptional creations of universal style, which depict themes related to motherhood, womanhood, land, and roots.
I approached him.
A correspondent of a Russian newspaper in Paris was asking questions.
There was also a Syrian-Armenian journalist.
When my turn came, I asked him about the exhibited new works created in the past two years.
- In art there is no old and new, the most important is what it says.
I work for my nation and struggle for the sake of my people’s cause through my art.
The monuments dedicated to the victims of the Armenian Genocide already "talk" about it.
Today, our weapon is our art, and only art can save us", replied the Master.
This exhibition was organized by the permanent representations of UNESCO in Armenia and Syria in cooperation with the Hamazkayin Educational and Cultural Association.
Most of the more than a hundred attendees were French people and also Syrian intellectuals, artists, painters who had been familiar with the sculptor’s creations long before.
After the official speeches of the organizers, the solo performance of the famed oudist, born in Aleppo, Fawaz Baker was a pleasant surprise.
He first played one of the creations of the renowned Armenian violinist and kanon player Tadeos Effendi (Tadeos Ekserdjian, 1858-1913), who lived in Constantinople at the end of the 19th century. His second play was in memory of his first music teacher in Aleppo, Hovhannes Kostanyan.
At the end, the guests were treated to eastern delicious dishes in the next hall.

Four-Day Magnificent Festival Dedicated to the 50th Anniversary of Hamazkayin New York
The New York Chapter of Hamazkayin was founded on May 5 of 1967 at New York University’s Lop Student Hall, in the presence of 55 young people.
New York Community accepted the foundation of the new chapter with great enthusiasm and encouraged its activities.
Moreover, for fifty years without a break, we kept and preserved the cultural heritage entrusted to us and didn’t spare any effort to pass it to the next generation.
The 50th anniversary is the fruit of all our exertions, boundless dedication, and unshakable faith.
Putting aside the full list of our achievements, we should note that in the last fifty years, 2311 people actively participated in our cultural events. The 1591 of them, that is the 69%, were young boys and girls.
614 people participated in the choir, 405 people in the theater activities and 842 young people took part in recitation and knowledge competitions.
The festival was the result of their collective efforts.
The idea, planning and the realization of the Festival belongs to the founding member Dr. Hrant Markarian.
He edited the Houshamadyan consisting of 145 pages and the statements, clarified the press conference materials, provided the participants of the press conference and of cultural events, and successfully created Khrimian Hayrig’s personage in the play telling about his life.
The program dedicated to the 50th anniversary pursued two objectives. The first objective was, within our struggle for national survival, to celebrate the anniversary of our cultural association, and to remind about our concerns for Armenian longevity.
The second was the four-day program, which was a response to the four-day April War instigated by Azerbaijan last year, to destroy Artsakh.
Azerbaijan resorted to demoniac war, but we spread light through our celebration.
We state that Artsakh has indisputable rights and a mission in history.
We support Artsakh and its security is our supreme duty.
Therefore, we donate all the proceeds of the festival to provide Artsakh with special life-saving devices, which stop bleeding.
The three events of the four-day program took place at Pashalyan Hall of Surp Lusavorich Church and the fourth was in the Armenian Center.
We express our gratitude to the spiritual pastor of the Surp Lusavorich Church, Father, Priest Mesrop Lagisian, and the ARF Armen Garo Committee, which provided their halls for our events.
Special thanks to Lalique Vartanian for her exclusive support.
We send our deep gratitude to Tamar Lagisian and Zenob Tomagian for the photographs.

Georges Sarkissian Theater Group of UAE stages performances
Organized by the theater committee of the Moushegh Ishkhan Separate Chapter of Hamazkayin in the United Arab Emirates, a group of young people with love for theater took the stage on March 30, 2012. They were part of the George Sarkissian Theater Unit and performed the play “Grounge g ganche” (“The crane calls,”) staged by Norair Kazanjian.
For more than two hours the play captured the audience’s attention, eager for the developments in the next act.
Only two of the 15 actors had previous experience in acting: Seta Mangassarian-Baliozian and Alice Mserlian as always personified their characters with their talent.
Mardo Hovsepian and Massis Kahkejian also successfully personified contrasting characters.
The clash between the patriot and the individual who turns his back on his nation made a deep impression upon the audience.
The conflict of duality of another character, Sdep, performed by George Ardag Eleijian was also communicated to the audience.
Was he Armenian or Australian? What was this unnatural conflict that started in his soul when he discovered his Armenian origin, when the crane called him?
That cry was that of his blood, stemming from his roots.
Maria Baghdoian in her role as an Australian would never understand the inner clash the man she loved was experiencing.
However, it wasn’t the same for Shaghig Eleijian, whose character, although born in Australia, could understand and perceive Step’s emotional tension, because she had grown up with an Armenian education and was living and thinking as an Armenian.
Nazareth Eleijian, Alen Tavitian, Hagop Manuelian, SevagGhazarian, and Khachig Manjigian were able to successfully present inter-party conflicts that are present in the Armenian reality and result in the difficulties that arise in the Armenian community life.
Njteh Kalleshian and Natalie Baghdoian also successfully personified their characters, while young Kevork Kazanjian was a revelation as a future actor.
Director Norair Kazanjian’s contribution was quite obvious in the success of the play.
Besides directing the play, he also took upon himself the tasks of stage decoration, music and lighting, all of which play a major role in the success of a play.
We also appreciate the efforts of the team who worked behind the scenes for the success of the play.

Gladzor Chapter of Hamazkayin in February (Canada)
February in Toronto is usually a month when people sit in front of their fireplaces and stay away from outdoor cold and blizzards. For more adventurous people or sport-lovers it’s a time to go to the mountains to ski or sled.
However, it was quite different this year. The month was full of cultural events, in spite of the heavy cold, nonstop snow, and freezing rain that, especially in the first half of the month, turned the city into a white, glassy plain.
In such situation what can make a person happy? Of course, it is laughter. So, let’s briefly, talk about Vahe Berberian's monodrama.
The performance of monodrama Uremn was organized by the Hamazkayin Dem Dimak Theater on February 10 and 11, 2018, three weeks after the popular musical performance Song of Armenia.
Let’s mention here that on January 26, the monodrama Song of Armenia (staged by Arshaluys Haroutiunian) was performed by the RA People's Artist Ashot Ghazarian, a very charming actress-singer Arpi Gabrielian and the popular talented actor Rafayel Yeranosian, and greatly inspired the Armenian community of Toronto.
At the beginning of February, the tickets for both performances of monodrama were sold out. The organizers had to organize the third performance at the people’s request. It took place on February 13th.
Those who know Vahe Berberian's performances clearly know what to expect. Berberian takes the subjects of his performances from our life, from people and our everyday life. He does not palliate or filter anything but just freely and sincerely presents the situation.
As Varag Papian said in his opening speech, "For most of us in this hall, Vahe Berberian is not an unknown name.
For many decades, he could put aside the shield guarding our nation, and with his virtuous and witty humor and in a very simple way he makes us stretch our legs and freely laugh."
So did the audience in the packed hall of Hamazkayin Armenian theater. The elderly and young Armenians from Syria, Persia, Lebannon, Canada, and Iraq laughed for two hours listening to the humorous stories taken from their lives, about their relationships, everyday life and their convictions.
At the end, Vahe Berberian's books and DVDs were sold, organized by the Book Delivery Library.
Story Hour for Children
Sunday, February 11, 2018, was one of the most overloaded days in the history of the Gladzor Chapter. There were three different events organized in one day; the second performance of Uremn Monodrama, Story Hour for Children and a Dance performance.
Gomidas 150th Anniversary Marked in Lebanon
The 150th anniversary of the birth of Gomidas was marked at Aztag’s Piunik Hall on February 14, 2020. Sponsored by the Hamazkayin Regional Executive Board, the event was organized by the Hamazkayin “Kousan” Choir in cooperation with the Vahe Setian Press.
Addressing teachers, Gomidas had written: “Approach the work of education with care and reverence. Your job is a very sensitive one. We are called upon to shape a generation, the future of the nation. If we guide them in the wrong direction, we will lead the nation to collapse.” Emcee Garen Arapgirian greeted the audience with this quote.
The speaker for the day was Haigazian University lecturer Shaghig Kandaharian-Hudaverdian. She discussed the cultural legacy of Gomidas, his reputation, and his message to Armenians.
Gomidas Remembered in Lebanon on his 150th Birthday
An evening dedicated to the 150th anniversary of the birth of Gomidas was held on March 8, 2020, at the Hagop Der Melkonian Hall in Beirut. The faculty of the the “Parsegh Ganatchian” School of Music and the “Shnorhali” Chorus of the Catholicate of the Great House of Cilicia performed. The event was held under the auspices of the Krikor Bedros XX Gabroyan, the Catholicos-Patriarch of Cilicia of the Armenian Catholic Church. It was sponsored by the Hamazkayin Regional Executive Board for Lebanon. It was organized by the trustees of the Hamakayin Schools of Fine Arts.
Among those present were Very Rev. Fr. Anania Kujanian, Minister of Youth and Sports Vartiné Ohanian, clergy, representatives of organizations, and lovers of arts.
After the Lebanese and Armenian anthems were performed, Lisa Bastajian, a trustee of the Hamakayin Schools of Fine Arts, delivered opening remarks. Despite the difficult conditions in Lebanon, Hamazkayin felt the duty to remember, honor, and venerate the modest but creative songwriter, musicologist, founder of Armenian classical music, and savior of Armenian song on his 150th birthday. She added that the music and songs of Gomidas have always been received with awe everywhere from Ejmiadzin to Europe. Bastajian said the legacy of Gomidas lives; it is renewed in the mystical moments of piety that it brings about; it echoes from the stages of Armenian schools, where generations have sung and will continue to sing his folk songs; it persists through his student Parsegh Ganatchian, who followed Gomidas’s lead and in 1936 formed the Kousan choir in Beirut, and through the conservatory, established in 1983, that bears his name.
Gomidas Sesquicentennial Celebrated at Columbia University
On February 8, 2019, a celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of Gomidas was celebrated at Columbia University in the City of New York. The program was cosponsored by the Hamazkayin Regional Executive Board for the Eastern United States, the Armenian Center at Columbia University, and the National Association for Armenian Studies and Research.
Over 120 students, intellectuals, musicians, and representatives of organizations from various parts of the eastern United States attended.
Khachig Mouradian, a lecturer at Columbia, chaired the program.
The talented musicians Lucine Musaelian (soprano), Arsen Ketikyan (violin), and Vagharshak Ohanyan (baritone) performed works by Gomidas.
The keynote address was delivered by Professor Sylvia Alajaji, chair of the music department at Franklin & Marshall College.
In her presentation, titled, “Gomidas and the possibility of ‘Armenia,’” she covered Gomidas’s life from Istanbul to Ejmiatsin to Europe, his efforts to collect thousands of Armenian folk songs, his arrangements, and his important contributions to Armenian spiritual music.
Professor Alajaji said Gomidas was a bridge that connected all segments of the Armenian world, belonging equally to Eastern and Western Armenians. Through him, it was possible to conceive of a single entity, Armenia.
Good Job, Hamazkayin ! – “Anoush” Opera for Children (USA)
The students of Armenian schools in Los Angeles have been provided with opportunity to enjoy a beautiful musical performance organized by the Regional Executive Board of Hamazkayin West USA for three years in a row.
This year, during the visit of students from Yerevan "Armen Dickranian" Music School, the Hamazkayin Theatrical Unit grabbed the chance and immediately started the organization of the performance. Due to the support of all Armenian school managements and the Armenian language teachers, the students’ performance became a reality. More than 1,400 of students enjoyed a special and beautiful performance of "Anoush" Opera staged by children and for children, which took place on Monday morning, April 18, 2016, at "Alex" Theater Hall of Glendale. 
The representative of Hamazkayin Theatrical Unit, Narkiz Murinian delivered the opening speech of the event and warmly welcomed the students and teachers.
"Anoush" opera has been repeatedly staged in Los Angeles, while it has been permanently on stage in Armenia. For the people of Homeland, it has become a sacred piece of art due to Gohar Gasparian, Anna Nishanyan and others. Their little successor, a 10-year-old girl Ani captivated the audience with her powerful voice and vocal skills.
Her friends accompanied her in the role of other heroes of "Anoush".
Indeed, the visit of native "cranes", endowed with divine grace, created special enthusiasm among the audience, especially among the young boys, as the Armenian boys raised in America had never had an opportunity to witness such a professional level and almost a professional play. The opera by Armen Tigranyan and Hovhannes Tumanyan was staged with some modifications and the tragic end of the play was omitted.
The Hamazkayin "Ani" Dance Ensemble accompanied the performance and made exceptional contribution to its success.
Dance instructors Yeghia Hasholian and Suzy Parseghian-Darbinyan gladly accepted the offer to stage a harmonious dance selection in a very short period.
Without the participation of "Ani" Dance Ensemble the perfect staging of "Anoush" would hardly be possible.
A perfect opera worthy of respect, rightfully inciting hope for future, was performed and applauded due to the teachers’ unconditional dedication and serious approach, vocal training, high-level vocal abilities and consistent efforts.
"To satisfy the need of professional stage art among young and adult audience, to develop in them a unique taste and perception of Armenian art."
The Hamazkayin Society carries on its shoulders the sacred mission of promoting Armenian culture and educating especially the young students by providing them with opportunity to enjoy the relics of Armenian glorious art and learn about the creations of great authors of Homeland.
Consequently, they will not only fill proud of this heritage, but will be able to get rid of xenomania and obtain national spirit and cultural traditions.
Our gratitude to all principals that, after this exceptional performance, thanked the Hamazkayin Society in the name of their students, and for their contribution to the event.
At the end, each school had the opportunity to have a group photo with the young actors of "Anoush".
The Hamazkayin Theatrical Unit never spares efforts while organizing theatrical workshops for children or adults, or forming amature theatrical troupes, encouraging and training promising talents.
This noble goal will become a reality only due to faith and united efforts.
We are confident that this one ill also succeed and become a reality together with other cultural goals of Hamazkayin Society.
The dynamic activities of dance ensembles, choirs, art academy, crafts centers prove the above-said.

GOODBYE ANTOURA (Canada)
On Wednesday, 18 November 2015, at 8 pm, a hundred of book-lovers attended the presentation of Karnig Panian’s book "Goodbye Antoura" at Aharonian Hall of the Armenian Center.
The organizers of the event were the Tekeyan Cultural Association, Union of Istanbul Armenians and the Literary Committee of "Sanahin" Chapter of Hamazkayin.
Anahit Balian made the opening speech of the event. After welcoming the guests, she said that the book "Goodbye Antoura" reveals one of the tragic faces of the Genocide, which the reader knows partially.
"Goodbye Antoura" is the translated version of Karnig Panian’s "Memories of Childhood and Orphanage", which describes the Genocide survivor author’s childhood and adolescence.
The book has been translated by Simon Beudjekian who has settled in California from Lebanon. The audience listened to his videotaped speech where the translator said that the book is about young children, who didn’t completely understand the events occurring around them, but instinctively resisted when their identity appeared under threat.
He added that such biographic books certainly play a significant role in foreign circles and contribute to the process of international condemnation of the Armenian Genocide.
Who was Karnig Panian?
He was born in 1910, in the Anatolian village of Gurin.
When he was barely five years old, his family was subjected to exodus. He lost his mom, sister and brother on the way of deportation.
However, he was rescued together with other Armenian orphans. They were taken to Antoura Orphanage where Jemal Pasha had organized the Turkification of 100.000 Armenian orphans. The boy underwent there all the difficulties of orphanage life.
Then he was taken to the orphanage of Jbeil with his survived friends, where he received a sound national spirit education.
Her life in the orphanage fortified his spirit of struggle and endurance, due to which he victoriously overcame the hardships of his life.
After the orphanage years, he entered life and became a craftsman. He worked in electrical business.
Later, feeling endless desire for learning, he managed to enter the seminary and left his job. It was in 1930.
After five years, in June 8, 1935, he was among the first eight graduates of Jemaran.
Later, the life took him to the world of learning, tuition, books and literature.
He got married and had two children, Houri and Shaghik.
He was known as a teacher of the Armenian language and Armenian studies in Jemaran or elsewhere.
He was the Vice Principal of Jemaran at the time when Levon Shant was the Principal. At the time of Simon Vratsian, he was the Assistant Director together with Mushegh Ishkhan.
In 1936, together with his graduate friends, Karnig Panian established the Alumni Association of Jemaran.
Since 1944, he was the founder member of the Alumni official "Agos" and its editor.
Karnig Panian was a permanent and active member of Hamazkayin, he was either a simple member or Board member, secretary or an administrative clerk.
At his teenage years, he was already ARF member and hold responsible positions there.
He worked for different national agencies, particularly as a member and chair of the National Council. He also was National MP and one of the prominent political figures of the political and provincial Assemblies.
In 1970, Khoren I Catholicos awarded him the "Mesrop Mashtots" medal for his long-term educational, cultural and national activities.
Teacher, intellectual and public figure, Karnig Panian humbly served his nation all his life. He really deserves admiration for his diligent and disciplined work.
His entire life was a dedication to his nation, Armenian language, Jemaran, Hamazkayin Society and to the figures of the Armenian Culture.
He died in July 23, 1989.
Then, Anahit Balian invited Ms. Silva Amatuni from Tekeyan Cultural Society to present Dr. Garbis Harboyan’s biography and to invite him to present the book "Memories of Childhood and Orphanage".
Dr. Harboyan scrupulously introduced the author's life, his sufferings on the road of exodus, where he lost his family members and tasted lots of hardships, the hellish life of Antoura Orphanage, the Turkification of orphans, hunger and sufferings.
From time to time, the speaker read extracts from the book, and simultaneously presented some subject-related slides on the screen.
After presenting Karnig Panian’s incredibly thrilling and tragic life, Anahit Balian said, "Despite all those sufferings, Armenian people exists and will certainly exist ever after. Our slogan is - we remember and claim". Then she continued her speech noting that Armenians greatly contributed to ceremonies dedicated to the Centennial of the Armenian Genocide working in the spheres of politics, propaganda, public, as well as in publishing sphere. The Armenian artists were also involved in those activities.
Then, a very interesting videotape was presented to the audience, where an artist (unfortunately, we were unable to find out her name) was making different images with her fingers and sand under the music of Gomidas. At the end of this interesting presentation, she wrote, "We remember 1915 Genocide."
Then, Silva Amatuni presented the author's daughter Houri Panian who had been the principal of St. Stephen's College in Boston for 27 years, and had made great efforts to enlarge the college and to enhance its quality. Aram I Catholicos awarded her the "Mesrop Mashtots" medal and the National Prelacy awarded her the "Queen Zabel" medal.
Houri Banian thanked the three associations, which organized the presentation of her father’s book.
She also explained why she had organized the translation of the book, and how her family and the diaspora accepted her initiative.
She spoke about the publishing house of Stanford University, which had published the book. The introduction and epilogue were written by Prof. Keith Watenpaugh, a lecturer from the Human Rights Department of University of California in Davis, the students of which will study the book in the coming years.
Prof. Keith Watenpaug has welcomed Houri Panian’s initiative concerning the translation of the book "Goodbye Antoura", saying that it is not only a literary value but also a human rights documentary discussing issues concerning humanity, such as identity, violation of children's rights and post-genocide repairs.
Houri Panian also told how impressed she had been after visiting St. Jacob College that morning.
At the end of the event Anahit Balian concluded her speech saying, "This book reminds the world that no historic truth can be buried even after 100 years.
The survival instinct and love for life helped those orphans to find ways to survive, overcome hunger and unimaginable sufferings and the same survival instinct and the will to fight against injustice have united us all now and encourage us to remind the world about the realities of the past and be more organized, more vigilant and cautious today and in the coming years."
Toward the end, each participant left taking a books signed by Houri Panian as averment of sympathy towards those orphans and their painful fate and averment of will to renew the struggle for justice.

Graduation Ceremony at M. and H. Arslanian Djemaran and Final Grade Certification Granting (Lebanon)
The ceremony took place on Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7: 00, at "Dr. Karakashian " Sport Hall of Hamazkayin M. and H. Arslanian Djemaran, in the presence of Prelate of the Armenian Diocese in Lebanon, Bishop Shahe Panossian, Armenia's Ambassador to Lebanon, Samvel Mkrtchyan, Hamazkayin Central Executive Board, Djemaran’s Board of Trustees, management, staff, parents, graduates and friends.
After the anthems of Lebanon and Armenia, the celebration began with presenting Djemaran’s history.
First, the martyred intellectuals’ pictures were presented on the screen accompanied by the song «Ils sont tombés». The final grade students Hagop Tashdjian and Christ Proudian, reproducing Levon Shant’s and Nicole Aghpalian’s voices, presented the history of Djemaran’s foundation, which took place on March 3, 1930 for the sake of preserving the identity, culture and the language of the Armenian people, which had been subjected to exodus in the result of the Armenian Genocide.
"Armenian Djemaran was scientifically established as a family. In school life, the mutual relationships between the students and teachers are not formal, but outwardly or inwardly, psychologically they are friendly, simple and natural.
This type of treatment is not understandable for some people, because it differs a bit from their idea, which they have about the school," says Levon Shant.
The pictures of Djemaran graduates of 1935 were displayed on the screen, after which the history of Djemaran, its prosperity were presented, starting from Djemaran’s official opening on May 27, 1950 up to our days.
Djemaran’s principals Simon Vratsian and Hrach Dasnabedian with their commandments were also included in the presentation of Jemaran’s history.

Director of Hamazkayin Art Schools, Hagop Handian delivered a speech and talked about the imperative of preserving the Armenian values and identity, ensuring the continual existence of the nation.
He said that during the last hundred years, the Armenian people of the Diaspora could only survive and preserved the Armenian identity in the imposed community life, through our culture. If we stopped fighting against assimilation threat and lost the five core elements of our identity - Homeland, Religion, economy, morality, and Armenian art, we would not endure as a nation.
"As successors of the Armenian art, we should be well aware of it; otherwise, sometimes, even unconsciously, we can distort or convert the genuine Armenian art. In foreign environments we are naturally influenced by foreign arts, but we ought to consciously preserve our dear and native Armenian and bring it into our everyday life.″

Grandmother’s Remedies (Canada)
Long before modern medicine and until the end of the last century, our parents used to heal any pain or disease following our grandmothers’ and sometimes grandfathers’ prescriptions and skillfully made healing preparations and measures.
They used saliva mixed with a pinch of soil in case of bee bite, yogurt in case of sunburnt skin, garlic ointment to clean eyelash pus, ground ginger-sugar in case of throat cough, vinegar as antiseptic, and cloths soaked in vinegar-water mixture to damp down the patient’s high temperature....
In case of gastric and intestinal disorders, they used Moloshov soup (Stinging nettle).
These techniques and remedies are part of our ethnic culture and its development evolution.
Analists interested in folk culture believe that these independent measures guarantee the people's endurance and survival in any environment and its conditions.
On 19 November 2016, a very useful "Coffee, tea and opinions" gathering took place at the ″Aharonian″ Hall of the Armenian Center, organized by the ″Sanahin″ Chapter of Hamazkayin, and prepared due to tireless efforts of Tiruk Manjikian. The topic of the day was ″Grandmother's Remedies″.
The participants of this gathering were the permanent members of all such previous discussions of the last three years, and those who were interested in the topic of the day.
As always, from the very beginning of the forum, Com. Manjikian successfully attracted the audience and focused their attention on the subject. Thus, the participation of the audience in the discussion was ensured, and they freely expressed many of their opinions and displayed laugh reactions.
Seda Mangassarian delivered a speech and opened the carefully prepared program.
She presented quite a funny piece from her performance "From Daily Life of Grandmother Mary" closely connected with the subject, after which Com. Manjikian delivered a speech on the topic.
After the presentation of grandma’s remedies in the first part of the program, she read an extract from Dr. Garbis Harboian’s ″Doctor G″ about our grandmothers’ healing abilities and skillfully made remedies.
The presented range of them was rather long. Any disease had its proposed treatment, sometimes quite a logical one, which we have been using so far, but sometimes they were rather absurd and based on beliefs and prejudice.
After this presentation, Tiruk Manjikian started the discussion related to each part of our body, from toes up to the head.
It was rather interesting that no one proposed any remedy against any mental illness. Instead, almost all of the participants of the discussion proposed healing remedies for each part of the body.
Moreover, all remedies, ointments or food proposed against body pain or disease were coming from Western Armenian cities and villages, skipping Lebanon and Egypt. After all, our grandmothers came from Western Armenia and not from the Diaspora.
Thus, not only the number of remedies increased, but also their options…
The present physicians and pharmacists approved some of those remedies and expressed doubts towards the others...
Prior to the second part of the program, Vrej-Armen Artinian read an interesting story by Viken Khechoomian called "Love Remedy", which somehow filled the gap between the physical pain and the mental.
The second part of the program, dedicated to prejudices, superstitions, and social customs turned into traditional, started.
Tiruk Manjikian first gave the definition of the word "prejudice", which means ″to believe in the occult and supernatural forces and be fearful of their influences and consequences″.
According to Malkhasian dictionary, ″superstition″ means a deceptive opinion formed in the consequence of ignorance. In the discussed examples, one of the dominant unfounded beliefs was the 13th day of the month called unlucky day.
This part of the program was very interesting and caused a lot of laugh.
Now we live in a completely different time. The generations have changed, and fear is not dominant in our life any more. So long as the source of superstition is fear, the only way to overcome difficulties and fear is to get rid of them mentally and live free of them.
In fact, not only we have prejudices and beliefs.
Their different options are spread everywhere and especially on the east side of the world.
The main countries where people believe in superstitions are India, China, Mexico, Arab countries, Greece etc.
Here are some of the superstitions:
The members of the discussion expressed their opinions about superstitions and the reasons that make people believe in them.
Com. Manjikian, however, rightfully said, "If we do not believe in the evil eye, and if it doesn’t exist, then why there is a prayer on page 94 of Cyprian prayerbook called ″Prayer for evil eye and evil tongue″, which, I am sure, some of us often read in fear".
It is short but powerful prayer, which asks the God to protect from evil eye, evil tongue and the sword, and of all visible and invisible stabs."
Then Tiruk Manjikian concluded by saying, "Consequently we should protect ourselves from evil eye, tongue, or supernatural evils by praying."
And then she raised the question. "Can we allow our everyday life be dependent on invisible enemies, and live in horror?"
″Coffee, tea, and opinions" gatherings take place regularly.
They are interesting and the atmosphere during the discussions is very pleasant. We not only listen to different opinions of the speakers but also express our own opinions, learn from each other and get to know each other.

TORONTO, CANADA—The 14th installment of Hamazkayin’s annual Pomegranate (POM) Film Festival took place from Nov. 13-17 in Toronto, during which 50 films from more than a dozen countries were showcased in three different theaters around the city.

The 14th POM also set a new festival record for number of sold-out shows.
This year, Hamazkayin’s online cultural platform, h-pem, was named as POM’s official media partner.
Throughout the five-day festival, all 50 films—from shorts, to documentaries, and feature films—were highlighted on h-pem’s social media channels, including Instagram (@hpemonline) and Facebook (facebook.com/hpemonline).
A panel on Western Armenia, which featured author Matthew Karanian, filmmaker Ani Hovannisian, and explorer Steven Sim, as well as the festival’s closing and awards ceremonies, which featured “Armenia Uncovered” director Andy Simon and the film’s star, comedian and musician Kev Orkian, were live-streamed on h-pem.
“Initiatives like the Pomegranate Film Festival are so important for young Armenian filmmakers such as myself,“ said LA-based director Tigran Nersisian, whose short film “Out of Mind” made its Canadian debut on Saturday.
“We are also lucky to have platforms like h-pem, where our hard work can be featured for all to see,” he mentioned when speaking to h-pem.
A one-minute explainer video about h-pem and its purpose was also shown before each screening throughout the festival.
Leading up to this year’s installment, h-pem featured four articles about the festival and some of the featured films: Festival board members Araz Hasserjian and Dr. Roubina Shnorhokian contributed pieces on what to expect at this year’s festival, as well as the festival’s 14-year history, while h-pem assistant project manager Lilly Torosyan and editor Rupen Janbazian highlighted Carla Kekejian’s short documentary “Harsneren,” Ani Hovannisian’s “The Hidden Map,” and Matthew Karanian’s The Armenian Highland.
“[POM] was founded by a group of young Armenian professionals, bound by a passion for film and culture.
POM is a unique community event celebrating Armenian-inspired film; a festival that remains the largest of its kind in the Armenian Diaspora.
The Festival presents topics relevant to Armenian and Canadian culture through the medium of films submitted from all around the world. In doing so, it creates a platform for burgeoning Armenian talent and the community to intermingle,” wrote Hasserjian for her exclusive piece for h-pem.
Since it was first launched in 2006, POM has showcased over 450 films from over 60 countries and has been run entirely through the efforts and tireless work of a group of dedicated volunteers.
Hagop Garabents Person and Writer (Canada)
Although, the diaspora writer Hagop Garabents mostly lived in the United States of America, his inner world combined three different continents - his birthplace Tabriz, Armenia, which he was proud of, and, which inspired his soul and mind in creating literery works, and of course, the United States, which provided his future education and wide recognition.
Unfortunately, the writer's creations were not available to his native reader.
The truth is that in his works, which often are within the Tabriz-US-Armenia triangle, he seeks for himself and for a native appropriate society accepting his thoughts and ideas as its own.
In fact, the event dedicated to Hagop Garabents writer showed that there really exists such a society in the Diaspora interested in the writer's literary creations reflecting his deep and sensitive soul.
The event organized by the Literary Committee of Hamazkayin Gladzor Chapter took place on 20 January 2017, at the Hamazkayin Theater. It began with screening a DVD telling the writer’s life and work in detail.
Garabents delivered a speech in the video and expressed his fury and protest coming from the depth of his heart.
Those were feelings, which by his own testimony, had served as a basis for his creations. His anger toward injustice of life, and not only Armenian life but universal, is expressed in his literature.
There Garabents clearly expresses his thoughts about the importance of conscious patriotism, Armenian culture, land and language.
Chair of Gladzor Chapter, Tamar Donabedian Kuzuian delivered the opening speech of the event saying that for the book lover community of Toronto the gathering was not the first of its kind, but was a long awaited opportunity to remember once again the writer's service, his previous visit to Toronto, and his meetings with the Toronto Armenian Community.
Mrs. Tamar Donabedian Kuzuian briefly presented the writer's life and work. She said that the organized event was a good opportunity to show respect to the writer and appreciate his literary work.
The guests enjoyed the sophisticated artistic program, which included very beautiful performances.
First, soloist Melania Shamahian performed the piece Mother, accompanied by the Hamazkayin Armenian Stars Choir and pianist Vanik Hovhannisian.
Then, Hayk Harutyunyan read an excerpt from A Man and a Country by Hagop Garabents, and pianist Narek Garamartian performed Karoun a by Gomidas.
Hamazkayin's Kousan Choir member, soloist, Silva Khachikian professionally performed the song Don't Cry Anymore, accompanied by pianist Vanik Hovhannisian.
After an introduction, the event conductor presented the keynote speaker, Dr. of International Law and Diplomacy, Armenian Review's editorial staff member, Zorian Institution's administrative staff member, translator, editor, Dr. Ara Ghazariants that has closely studied the writer's literary creations, his emotional outbursts, the issues, about which the author was concerned, including his thoughts about Armenia, Artsakh and the Diaspora.
The honorable speaker expressed his gratitude to Hamazkayin for initiating the event 23 years after the writer's death, and for providing an opportunity to speak about such a great writer like Garabents.
After presenting the life and activities of Garabents, Dr. Ara Ghazariants pointed to the fact that Garabents opened a new page in the history of modern Armenian literature through his creations, and occupied his unique and deserved place as an interpreter of the genereations' emotions, dreams and concerns in the Diaspora.
In his analytical approach, the speaker noted, "Garabents, in his elegant artistic style, successfully linked the Armenian and the universal together, always staying faithful to the Armenian unique virtues.
No one can match him in making deep psychological analysis, especially concerning the Armenian's unique inner world.
In his descriptions, the language and style innovations, through which he equally speaks about both the native Armenian life and that of the diaspora, are noteworthy."
Then, he mentioned that the roots of Garabents were from Artsakh, and he had strong faith and belief toward the new history of Artsakh.
At the end of his speech, honorable speaker once again stressed that the writer’s pen taken the path of struggle, has moved to eternity in bold steps.
Toward the end of the event, the chapter chairperson expressed gratefulness to Dr. Ghazariants and presented him as a gift the Through the Lens of my Inner World book of photos taken by the writer’s friend and Hamazkayin member Galust Papian called.
At the end of the program, Antoinette Manoukian performed the musical piece Prelude h-moll on the piano. Afterwards, the Literary Committee member Varag Papian read the piece My Son, the Sun and the Sea from the book of Garabents A Man and a Country.
Hagop Garabents dedicated his entire life to the idea One Nation, One Homeland and strove for it.

Hamazkayin has shown itself to be a guardian and apostle of Armenian culture, right next to the Armenian church,” said His Holiness.
He also referenced the decades of close cooperation between the Great House of Cicilia and Hamazkayin, and the importance of continuing to strengthen that bond, especially since it serves a role in preserving the Western Armenian language and Armenian culture more broadly.

Second, to prepare cadres of Armenian teachers for the community’s schools. And ensure that the community has a supply of informed members, fluent in Western Armenian, to participate in organizational and communal affairs.
The institute had continued its work for 24 years. Neither war, nor economic difficulties, nor the emigration of a significant portion of its faculty have been able to stop its progress.
Maintaining this institute was essential for maintaining our language and culture—much like air and water are essential to life.
The institute had difficulties. Its path was not without ups and downs. But it stayed the course. The faculty and students, administrators and boards worked hand in hand to keep it going.
The Hamazkayin Syria Regional Executive Board took every measure to meet the institute’s needs, especially in the difficult circumstances of the present.

Hamazkayin Announces a New Initiative, in Song
We’re all living through a difficult time, especially because of the restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, and in the case of Lebanon, also because of the catastrophe of the explosion on August 4, 2020, at the Port of Beirut, and its consequences.
Hamazkayin has not stopped its cultural and educational activities, thanks to the tireless and dedicated efforts of our regional executive boards and chapters, and of the staff of our schools, including our jemarans and schools of art.
We’re glad to announce a new initiative today, one that both helps keep our cultural path well-lit and honors the great writer, poet, and educator Moushegh Ishkhan who died thirty years ago.
We present to the Armenian public our contribution to the Armenian playlist, a cooperative effort between artists from Armenia, Artsakh, and the Armenian diaspora.
Armenuhi Karapetyan, the talented composer from Armenia, transformed Moushegh Ishkhan’s poem “Hay Hokin” (Armenian spirit) into a song. No fewer than 26 well-known singers and musicians performed it jointly.
Without the gift of their participation, this initiative could not have been realized.
The music video is ready. It had its debut on the Hamazkayin Western U.S.A. program, “For You, Lebanon,” on September 19, 2020.
By putting Ishkhan’s poem, which defines the essence of Armenianness, to music, we are certain that the memory of the poet and the song will live long in the Armenian consciousness.
We publicly thank all the artists who accepted our invitation and participated in this initiative.

Hamazkayin Armenian Stars Children Choir’s Inspirational Performance (Canada)
Seeing the performances of the young children’s songs, dances, recitations, or their paintings makes us extremely happy and hopeful. After all, they are our today’s hope and the light of our future.
The Hamazkayin Armenian Stars Children Choir’s birth seven years ago was a bold initiative aimed at preserving and promoting the Armenian songs and music. Today, the pure Armenian songs performed by the choir members, from four-year-olds to young boys and girls, is one of the biggest victories against the xenomania.
On Wednesday, 7 June 2017, parents and relatives, and the community members who encourage the promotion of Armenian songs packed the Hamazkayin Theater in Toronto.
The Hamazkayin Armenian Stars Children Choir was giving its annual concert.
The diversity of 20 songs included in the program showed conductor Hripsime Tovmasian's skillful and professional approach, and her decisive steps to win great achievements.
The longtime member and solo singer of Armenian Stars, Mineh Tsaturyan opened the concert, addressing the Hamazkayin Association, the conductor of the choir and pianist Vanik Hovhannisian.
Here, the little children of Group A appeared on the stage in a discreet manner, occasionally glancing at the audience.

Then the children with great enthusiasm performed the songs It’s not a Joke, Dwarf Song, Do Re Mi, Grandpa and Grandma, and Yerevan in chorus attentively following the conductor’s gestures.
The performance of Group B was like a flight over the kindness trees to the world of dreams and joyful carousels. Our stars performed the Building Song, Dream, Happy Carousel and Kindness Tree songs with special enthusiasm and confidence. The quality of the songs, the harmony of the complementary voices, which was the result of careful and scrupulous work, was obvious.
Then we reached Armenia, our Homeland, and ″Our Lovely Yar from Mountains″. Group C performed the Armenia, Our Sweet Motherland, Sari Sirun Yar, and many other lyrical songs. It was really a good start, followed by lively songs, which took us to Artsakh and Western Armenia through a magic road.
Groups B and C performed the songs Our World, My Karabakh, Yerevan, It got Dark, March of Zeytun and Fairy Road in unison.
The work done and efforts made were obvious. The solo singing by Mineh Tsaturyan gave a special brilliance to the performance.
The program included songs for children, as well as folk, lyrical, and national songs. Finally, all the groups sang the song We are Armenians in a very high mood and received long applause.
The administrative representative of the Choir’s Board, Lorig Gatrdjian delivered the closing speech of the event. She highly appreciated Hripsime Tovmasian’s and pianist Vanik Hovhannisian’s contribution and their best virtues, and particularly their striving for the best results.
Conductor Hripsime Tovmasian, in her turn, specifically thanked the honored pianistVanik Hovhannisian for his musical talent and humble and patient character.

Hamazkayin Art Schools in Lebanon to Reopen on Schedule
The Hamazkayin Regional Executive Board for Lebanon and the Trustees of the Schools of Art held joint meetings over the past few weeks to examine the future activities of the schools in the light of the crisis.
The board is sparing no effort to overcome existing problems and challenges.
Accordingly, the board notifies parents that Hamazkayin will open the schools in the new year, insofar as the decisions to be taken by Lebanese government will allow it.
In other words, with the beginning of the new school year, the Levon Shant and Jirair and Tsoline Jirair Khatchadourian Cultural Centers will open too and instruction in the art schools will resume.
Some units have already started their rehearsals and meetings.
The board considers the contribution of artists from Armenia essential to the schools. In the 2020–21 school year, Karen Makinyan and Jacqueline Sarkhoshyan will come from Armenia to teach dance and ballet. The veteran artist Hovik Garakhanyan will return to teach violin.
The arrangement have already been made.
The Hamazkayin Schools of Art have a pivotal role in Lebanese-Armenian cultural life, enriching it and helping shape the new generation through art.
This remains a calling for us and gives meaning to our efforts.
We are confident that parents too will approach these efforts conscientiously and supportively as well and together we will succeed in keeping the torch of the schools raised high.
The schools have a great role to play in the popularization of Armenian culture and art.
Hamazkayin owns its role and will remain true to it.

Hamazkayin Book-Lovers’ Forum (Canada) Love in Literature
Tamar Donabedian Kouzouian
On Wednesday, April 5, 2017, the theme of the Forum at the Hamazkayin Y. Manoogian Library was love.
The way any writer speaks about the love on pages of our literature depends on his inner world, thoughts, environment, experiences, and his style of writing...
For Vahan Tekeyan, which is considered as a poet of love, "the best love is that is kept in silence.” He writes, "I loved, but none of my beloved ones knew how much I loved her! Whoever can understand the heart? "
Sevak’s and Charents’ confession of love was emancipated and extravagant in the words when meeting or leaving their beloved ones.
The Armenian poet from Argentina, Alicia Giragosian writes, ″Love is more memory than presence.″

Hamazkayin Celebrates 90th Anniversary Globally
Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society is celebrating its 90th anniversary in 2018.
After the central kickoff event on September 9 in Yerevan, each of the organization’s regions and chapters is celebrating the occasion in its own way.
Three events have already taken place. On August 12 in Brazil, on October 7 in Paris, and on October 14 in Canada.
Upcoming celebrations include an event in Australia on October 28, one in the Western United States on November 3, in Sweden on November 4, in Greece on November 24, in Cyprus on December 1, in Syria later in December, and in Lebanon in January 2019.
Hamazkayin Central Executive Board urges international organizations to take immediate action against the cultural genocide in Artsakh.
We are extremely troubled by the latest reports of surging vandalism and destruction of Armenian churches, monasteries, cemeteries and cultural monuments in Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh).
Since the start of the war in September 2020 and the occupation of historical Armenian towns and cities, we are witnessing systematic attempts to erase the indigenous Armenian cultural heritage of Artsakh.
These recent events are yet another evidence of a legacy of cultural genocide perpetrated by the Azerbaijani and Turkish authorities over decades in historic Armenian lands.
These recent actions of the Azerbaijani authorities in Artsakh represent significant premeditated efforts to forge history through Albanization of the Armenian cultural heritage in Artsakh and to use the pretext of renovation and restoration to erase evidence of the indigenous presence of Armenians on that land.
The government of Azerbaijan reported the start of “restoration efforts” of the Holy Savior Cathedral in Shushi by removing the 19th-century conical dome of the cathedral.
This same cathedral was targeted by the Azerbaijani army missiles during the latest war on Artsakh and the current “renovation” is intended to change the cultural identity of the cathedral which symbolizes the Armenian identity of Shushi.
The international media has documented similar destructive acts in the complete destruction of churches and the use of gravestones from cemeteries in villages of Hadrut for the construction of roads.
Azerbaijan is not honoring its commitment towards the international community as a signatory to the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and to the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage where it endorses the responsibility of protecting, preserving and transmitting cultural and natural heritage to future generations. It has also obstructed the proposed UNESCO mission to Artsakh for the assessment of the situation of cultural properties in that region.
Since the ceasefire agreement on 10 November 2020, a number of international organizations have called for the conservation and protection of cultural heritage in Artsakh[1].
In its 2021 annual report the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) recommended the placement of Azerbaijan on the US Department of State Special Watch List for severe religious freedom violations.
Considering that Azerbaijan is undermining the above mentioned calls for its responsibility in preserving the Armenian cultural heritage in Artsakh and is continuously breaching the international conventions, and in view of the UN Security Council’s condemnation of the “unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, inter alia destruction of religious sites and artefacts”, we call upon the international community to condemn Azerbaijan’s actions in erasing the indigenous cultural heritage of the Armenian people in Artsakh and to exert all efforts in halting this cultural genocide.

In recent years, there has been a parade featuring well-known artists who leave their mark on the municipality’s cultural history.
This year’s programming included exhibits of books and drawings, concerts, recitals, and so on.
On May 5, 2019, the program featured performances by ten different dance ensembles. Among them was the Hamazkayin “Nanor” Dance Ensemble of Greece.

On May 29, 2022, the 22d annual concert of the Hamazkayin Sipan, Ani, and Giligia Dance Ensembles and the Nanor Children’s Dance Ensemble, under the direction on Krikor Keleshian, was held at the Strovolos Municipal Hall. The event was organized by the Hamazkayin Cyprus Oshagan Chapter.
The event was dedicated to the Melkonian Educational Institution. It was carried live on the chapter’s Facebook page, which allowed Melkonian alumni around the world to follow it.
The concert was held under the aegis of Annita Demetriou, Speaker of the House of Representatives of Cyprus, and Vartkes Mahdessian, member of parliament for Armenians in Cyprus.
A delegation from the National Assembly of the Republic of Artsakh, led by Speaker Artur Tovmasyan, which happened to be in Cyprus at the time, was present.
In the first part of the program, the audience enjoyed fifteen dances. The theme of the second part was Melkonian.
The Melkonian brothers Krikor and Garabed were represented on the stage. At first, they were conversing about starting an orphanage.
Then, they gradually saw its founding and development. During their conversation, the Sipan ensemble would come in with various dances.
Later, longtime Melkonian music teacher Vahan Bedelian and his successor Sepouh Abkarian had a conversation. Bedelian’s actual violin was shown on stage.
At the conclusion, the dance ensemble, under Abkarian’s direction, performed while the songs “Zartir Lao” and “Artyok ovker en” played.

The chairperson of Hamazkayin in Cyprus, Arto Tavitian, welcomed the minister. Minister Prodromou praised Cyprus Armenians for their loyalty and love toward their culture and praised Hamazkayin for its work, promising the ministry’s continued moral and financial support for the association’s efforts.
Then the thunder of the zurna and the roar of the dhol heralded the arrival on stage of the Sipan ensemble. The various ensembles performed for an hour and a half. The program included a modern dance duo by Anastasia Aghazarian and Jo Ghayad and the solo song “Yare Mardun Yara Guda” performed by Edgar Evoyan.
The guests left the hall with pride and enthusiasm. Whereas guests had been frustrated by the long wait for coronavirus screening at the beginning of the evening, they had forgotten all that by the time the wonderful program was over.
The (very thin) silver lining of not holding a concert last year because of the pandemic was that the 21st annual concert was held on 21 of November of 2021. This performance outshone all previous ones in its quality, décor, and accuracy.
Great work, everyone!

Since the times when people celebrated the International Day of Workers, the Town Halls traditionally have given approval to requests for organizing public official celebrations on May 1, 2017.
On that day of this year, the dance ensembles arrived from different regions of Greece, such as Smyrna, Crete, Imbros, Pontus, and Lesvos, and performed their own ethnic dances. The harmony of cultural diversity reigned over the central squares of Town Halls of Vyronas, Rentis, and Nea Smyrni etc.

Hamazkayin Forum Gathers Virtually for Two Days
Technology made distances and time melt away and put the whole world in our palm.
We no longer need board a long flight to see a long-lost friend who lives thousands of kilometers away. We can see each other on little devices we hold in our hands.
We no longer need to wait days to receive a photograph; it’s in our palm in an instant.
The pandemic gave new meaning to this transformation.
We started meeting not just distant friends but also neighbors in our palms.
School, clinic, stage, altar, and meeting room became a small corner of our rooms.
The Hamazkayin family too has held performances, events, meetings, and rehearsals around the world.
The Hamazkayin Student Cultural Forum, held for each of the previous 27 years, was called off because of the pandemic.
The war in Artsakh followed. An online version of the forum took place and the war, the pandemic, and the threats facing the Armenian people were the themes.
This time there were no age limits. Forum participants from previous decades even signed up. The invitation was open.
It was two days of presentations. Four speakers contributed, two on July 11, two on July 18, 2021.
The presentations focused on the Armenian people in general and on Artsakh in particular.
On July 11, the program began with an icebreaker featuring trivia.
The first speaker was Garine Papazian-Zohrabian, Ph.D., associate professor at the University of Montreal. Her talk was titled, “War, Pandemic, and Survival: The Psychological Challenges facing Armenian Youth.”
Dr. Papazian spoke about the effect of war and the pandemic on different groups of people; how individuals are affected by their environment; how the mental-health challenges can be overcome; how to approach issues and from what perspective.
The atmosphere was warm and friendly.
The forum participants, of all ages, participated lively in the discussion after the talk.
The second presentation was by Heghnar Zeitlian Watenpaugh, Ph.D., a professor of art history at the University of California, Davis, and the independent scholar Simon Maghakian. Their topic was, “Legacy of Armenian Monuments: Preservation and a Policy of Destruction.”
The talk revolved around the demolition of monuments, including khatchkars, over many years. They presented numbers and photographic evidence, which brought the danger home.
The discussion focused on ways and methods to stop the destruction.
The program for the second day, July 18, also included two presentations.
Hermine Avakyan, a poet and author from Artsakh, spoke about literature produced during the Artsakh War.
Avakyan spoke as an eyewitness to the terror of the war and said several writers were moved to write pieces of great immediacy.
The pieces discussed and excerpted were poems by Sergey Sarafyan (Nemrut), Vitaly Petrosyan, the martyr Hayaser Hovsepyan, and the speaker herself.
The second presentation was, “The Art of Carpet Weaving: A Testament to the Armenian Identity of Artsakh.”
Vartan Astzatryan of Artsakh and Hratch Kozibeyokian, president of the Armenian Rugs Society, from the United States, were the speakers.
Armenian carpets are examples and evidence of the particularity of Armenian art.
A specialist can readily tell what region of Armenia an Armenian rug is from.
Astzatryan talked about being alerted on the eve of the war and his experience with minimizing losses.
Sensing the danger of war, he managed to move some of the carpets to Armenia, but sadly most remained in Artsakh because of the lack of support and organization.
On November 9, the transfer of carpets from Shushi was stopped.
Kozibeyokian stressed the value of carpets and the efforts of the enemy to distort the their origins.
All of us, and especially the Armenian state, are to blame for not protecting our cultural heritage, he said; we have always expected catastrophe but have never prepared for it.
Kozibeyokian asserted that international institutions will not protect what the Armenian state has failed to protect.
Notwithstanding the particularity of the carpets and their millennial value, both speakers stressed, neither carpet weaving nor the protection of this heritage receives state support from the two Armenian republics. They remain a matter of private or community initiative, which is inadequate.
A discussion ensued.
This set of presentations was a first try at holding the forum virtually, and it was a success.
Everyone in the group had something to take away but also put something in.
Dr. Papazian-Zohrabian said, in her talk, “Relationships are fundamental to resilience.”

Dikran Bayatian, chairperson of the chapter executive board, made opening remarks. He said, “The art of the troubadour came to Armenia from the Arab world in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
In the 1700s, the greatest Armenian troubadour, or ashough, Sayat Nova, served as a bridge between medieval poetry, folk games, and his own poesy, founding the classical school of Armenian troubadour art.
Then, in the nineteenth century, in Gyumri, thanks to Ashough Djivani, the national school of Armenian troubadour art, anchored not only in the Armenian language but also national song forms.” 
He noted that Jivani and his worthy successor troubadours, Sheram, Havasi, Ashot, and Shahen, went on to crystalize Armenian troubadour art.
Mr. Bayatian explained the reason for the event. “Aware that Armenian troubadour art has had a great influence on the musical character of our people, continuing Hamazkayin’s mission and to keep alive the love for and interest in Armenian troubadour music in the new generation,” the chapter decided to organize this event.
He thanked all those who helped organize and realize the evening. The first part of the evening, he said, would be dedicated to Sayat Nova; the second, to a selection of the best of the other ashoughs.
He then invited Gilda Berberian, a talented reciter of poetry, to serve as emcee.
To open the artistic segment of the program, Ms. Berberian recited Yeghishe Charents’s “I dreamed Sayat Nova came to me, instrument in hand.” Shant Danielyan and Sagis Adamyan, visiting from Armenia, went on the stage along with the other musicians for the evening. As a group, they performed Sayat Nova’s masterpiece, “Kamancha.”
Ms. Berberian then recited Hovhannes Tumanian’s ode, “Like Ashough Sayat Nova.” A duet by Biayna Bablanian and Serena Garabedian followed. They performed “Even If They Gave Me Your Weight In Pearls,” and “You Are That Fairy.”
Vahe Tashjian performed “With the Nightingale.”
Then the Shakeh Dance Ensemble of Kuwait presented a delicate dance to accompany Sayat Nova’s “I Don’t Know Your Value.”
Adom Keheyan performed one of Sayat Nova’s most complex creations, “I Will Not Whinge in This World.”
Lucy Kahkejian performed Sayat Nova’s “Farhad Died and Shirin Said.”
The dance ensemble then danced to, “As Long As You Are My Love.”
In the second part of the program, creations of Sheram, Bagrat, Ashot, Sedrak, and Ashough Jivani were performed.
Lila Garabedian performed Sheram’s beloved and complex ode, “You Are My Muse.
Popular performer Kevork Temamian performed Bagrat’s, “You Are the Moon under a Cloud,” and Sheram’s, “No Life Remains in Me.”
Lucy Kahkejian and Keri Sarkisian performed the comedic, “Jealous Woman,” and Sarkisian sang Sheram’s, “You Are Leaving, Fare Thee Well.”
Next was Ashot’s, “Legitimate Birth in Zangezur,” and the young members of Shakeh performed a new dance. Then Sheram’s, “My Love, You’re Pretty,” was performed by Sarina Adanalian.
Rosdom Sargisian sang Sedrak’s “With Your Dark Eyes.”
The dancers performed alongside Sheram’s, “Shorora.” Then Rosdom Sargisian and Lila Garabedian sang Ashot’s “Pretty Mountain Girl.” 
Kevork Temamian returned to the stage with a selection of songs from Sheram.
At the end of the program, the singers together performed Ashough Jivani’s masterful “Be Mindful.”
Ms. Berberian read a note from the Hamazkayin of Kuwait thanking the donors, the vocalists, the dancers, the guests from Armenia, the dance instructors, those who worked behind the scenes and the members of all the committees of Hamazkayin who worked to bring the event together.
She invited the prelate to the stage to say a closing prayer.
The bishop congratulated Hamazkayin for its successful event and said, “Any nation or organization needs three things to survive and thrive: collective will, cooperative work, and modesty.
Thanking and lauding the performers from Armenia, the performers, their instructors, and the guests from Armenia, the vocalists, the dancers and their instructors, and everyone who worked or provided financial support. He said, “Thanks to you, on this foreign stage, Armenian song and poetry was heard and danced was seen and the stage became, for a few hours, an Armenian one.”
He called on the audience to keep alive the national and cultural heritage handed down through the generations, instilling love toward it in their children. He called on Hamazkayin members to keep up the great work and build on it.
Souvenir photos were taken with the prelate and the ambassador. The local press reported on the event immediately and live streamed it as well.

Attendees asked questions and received answers.
After lunch, the following individuals presented reports:
The rapporteurs provided the meeting with vital numbers about their jurisdictions and spoke about the programs they have implemented or are implementing. They mentioned success stories as well as challenges.
In broad terms, the meeting decided to increase outreach efforts; in gatherings and through announcements, to publicize Hamazkayin’s wide-ranging activities to the European public and draw them in.
As part of this effort, the meeting decided to develop a master list of human resources in Europe, to cooperate and join forces with sister organizations.
The meeting set the date for the next student gathering, YouthLinks Europe; it will be held in May 2020 in Marseille. Once the details are settled, the program will be publicized via social media.
The Marseille chapter executive board eagerly took on responsibility for organizing the gathering.
At the conclusion of the meeting, attendees received CDs of Armenian songs and of lectures in Armenian and other languages; children’s books; objects in the Lala and Ara children’s line; and flyers.

Hamazkayin in Cyprus Celebrates William Saroyan
Hamazkayin in Cyprus holds regular cultural evenings, and on January 16, 2019, the focus of the evening was the renowned Armenian-American author William Saroyan. The event took place at the Homenetmen-AYMA Club in Nicosia.
The chapter executive board chairperson, Arto Tavitian, opened the evening by welcoming the 25 to 30 members and friends in attendance, who showed up in spite of the cold and rain.
The first speaker was Hagop Kazanjian, who spoke of Saroyan’s life and writing, providing details of various stages of the author’s life, from childhood to old age.
He included the kind of personal detail that few of those present had been aware of.
Bishop Khoren Doghramajian was next to speak.
He focused on Saroyan’s Armenianness, notwithstanding the fact that Saroyan had come to prominence as an American writer.
Saroyan’s topic was America, even though ordinary Americans, who might be of Mexican, Japanese, Italian, Greek, or Armenian extraction; his message, however, was an Armenian’s message, the message of an Armenian who had kept true to his roots, the bishop said.
At the conclusion of the program, Mr. Tavitian read from Saroyan’s work, “Love’s Old Sweet Song,” translated into the Armenian by the veteran Cypriot-Armenian schoolteacher Hovhannes Sheohmelian.
Hamazkayin in Kuwait Marks 150th Anniversary of Gomidas
Gomidas, the talented musician, singer, conductor, teacher, collector of folk songs, and ethnographer, has been the focus of celebrations around the world since February 2019, on the 150th anniversary of his birth.
With his work ethic and attention to detail, the “Pontiff of Armenian Song,” to use Paruyr Sevak’s evocative phrase, was able to mine the treasures of Armenian music from the soon-to-be-destroyed Armenian hearth and to add them to the colorful mosaic of world music; to articulate a native Armenian national style, with its own wordlist and beautiful reverberances.
In short, if the Poet of All Armenians, the great Tumanian, is the Armenian word, then Gomidas is the Armenian melody. He saw song as an extension of speech.
Indeed, on October 23, 2019, under the auspices of Rev. Fr. Bedros Manuelian, Pontifical Vicar of the Armenian Prelacy of Kuwait and its neighboring countries, the Hamazkayin Kuwait Chapter Executive Board and the Embassy of the Republic of Armenia held a memorial evening for Gomidas on the 150th anniversary of his birth. A program of works by Gomidas was enthusiastically received.
His Excellency Sarmen Baghdasaryan, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Armenia to Kuwait, Consul Vartkes Hovsepyan, and members of the Kuwait Armenian Prelacy assembly and board, Armenian school administration and trustees, and representatives of organizations were in attendance.
Delivering the opening remarks fell on the shoulders of Dikran Bayatian, who welcomed the audience and spoke about the talent and legacy of Gomidas: “Gomidas was a unique great.
He gave back to our people our spiritual identity and underlined our role and place in a complex and colorful world.
Gomidas is our people’s pride and a bottomless source of national wealth.”
Through a video clip, George and Narine Arabatlian presented the honoree’s biography. They portrayed the young Soghomon who took the name Gomidas on his ordination, the student, the teacher, and the composer; the biography continued through the sad circumstances of his death.
Young musicians well versed in the work of Gomidas presented a selection of his creations. George Arabatlian interpreted “Hov arek,” accompanying his own singing on the piano.
Adom Kehyayan sang “Ganche Grung,” and Kevork Temamian sang “Horovel,” with Higo Pazian on piano.
Narine Konjayan-Arabatlian recited moving excerpts from Paruyr Sevak’s poem Anlreli Zangakatun.
On the invitation of the embassy, the Harmonia String Quartet was in Kuwait, and they performed a selection of Gomidas melodies. Wonderfully breathing life into the gems of Armenian song, the performers from Armenia were Ani Khachunts (first violin), Svetlana Lalayan (second violin), Yana Daryan (viola), and Aram Talalian (cello).
At the conclusion, the pontifical vicar praised the Hamazkayin chapter for its work over the last three years and then spoke of the greatness of Gomidas. “To speak of Gomidas means to speak of value, because our history includes people and events that are, in themselves, values. They are above the times in which they lived and they continue to live to this day.
Gomidas is not only a value for Armenians, and a source of pride, but he is a value to the world, his 150th birthday celebrated even by UNESCO.”
Concluding, he said, “We cannot be satisfied with remembering the past and feeling pride. Our duty, alongside remembering the past, is to create the future.”
Let us remember and salute our greats, live and bring life to our cultural legacy, which maintains and perpetuates our identity.

He is the first there, even before the coffee is brewed.
We truly value moral support and encouragement for our activities.”

Hamazkayin in the United Arab Emirates

On Friday, March 20, 2015 at 5: 30 pm, at "Pierre Keusseyan" Hall in Sharjah, the "George Sarkisian" theater performed the talented satirist Hagop Baronian’s comedy "The Flatterer". The Executive Board of "Mushegh Ishkhan" Separate Chapter of Hamazkayin was the organizer of the event.
The performance was attended by the United Arab Emirates and Qatar Patriarchal Vicar, Rev. Fr. Mesrop Sarkisian - the sponsor of the event, National Board Members, honored guests, and compatriots.
Vania Poladian made the opening speech. He spoke about the activities of the Executive Board, which every year organizes events aimed at consolidating the Armenian community and maintaining the Armenians’ cultural independence.
H.Baronian wrote "The Flatterer" in 1872, but he didn’t finish it. Later satirist E. Odian accomplished it.
The play is about the social and family relationships based on hypocrisy, corrupt morals, and the lifestyle of "The Flatterer" deceiving people for his own financial benefit.
In fact, Paronyan’s creations belong to the 19th century, but they are actual in nowadays, in our contemporary life and are sincere.
The staging of the play was entrusted to the distinguished artist, Norayr Kazanjian. Due to his efforts and the actors’ hard work, a unique performance was presented to the audience.

Hamazkayin is Organizing in Russia
Over a year ago, a spontaneously formed group in Moscow approached the Hamazkayin Central Executive Board with a proposal to create a Hamazkayin organization in Russia.
In-depth consultations were underway when the pandemic broke out.
It did not, however, stop the group for initiating cultural activities and periodic events.
On May 15, 2021, the founding congress of the Hamazkayin organization in Russia took place in Moscow in the presence of two members of the Central Executive Board and with the participation of around 30 individuals.
The participants agreed to form a three-member temporary executive board to manage ongoing activities, assemble a full list of members of the organization, devise a program of activities, and write bylaws. The temporary board will, on the basis of those bylaws, invite the first general assembly. The assembly will elect a new board.
A similar gathering took place in Saint Petersburg on May 17. Some fifteen individuals, including artists, participated.
After two hours of discussions, a temporary executive board was formed with a mission similar to that of the Moscow board.
We are confident that this new territory for Hamazkayin will come to play an important role in the development of the cultural life of the Armenian communities of Russia.
We wish the best to our comrades in Russia.

Hamazkayin Kayane Dance Ensemble Performs in Lebanon
Some 245 students enrolled in the Hamazkayin Kayane Dance Ensemble on 27 and 28 June, 2019, captured the attention of parents, guests, and lovers of arts at the Émile Lahoud Hall.
Avedis Guidanian, Lebanon’s minister of culture, sponsored the event. It was a recognition of the efforts of the Hamazkayin schools of fine arts and an endorsement of the belief in the new generation of Armenians who know to dance to the rhythm of Armenian music, to give life to Hovhannes Tumanian’s “Drop of Honey,” to grow up in a clean Armenian environment, take the stage with confidence, and show their talents.
All of this is thanks to the individuals responsible for the Hamazkayin structure in Lebanon, the army of volunteers gathered around them, and especially the dance instructors Mr. and Mrs. Garen and Jacqueline Maguinian. The intimate relationship between them and the students was on display all evening; it became especially obvious when they took the stage at the end alongside their students to celebrate the achievement.
It is easy to talk about having this number of young people regularly on the stage to show what they have been working on for the past many months, but it’s hard to imagine the effort and coordination that goes into having 245 boys and girls appear on stage in a harmonious, themed presentation, dancing precisely, in appropriate costumes, with appropriate hairdos and make-up. The diverse audience appreciated them and showed it with vigorous applause.

Hamazkayin Launches the h-pem Online Armenian Cultural Platform h-pem.com: Connecting Armenians through culture, art, and achievement
In 2014, Hamazkayin’s seventh General Assembly outlined the imperativeness of the creation of an innovative online platform to more effectively implement the organization’s mission and to reach Armenians in the diaspora—specifically the Diasporan Armenian youth.
H-Pem will reach Armenian communities around the world and help Armenians—particularly Armenian youth—(re)connect with their homeland and culture in new, creative, and cooperative ways.
H-Pem will carry out its mission by creating a space that is driven by quality, professionalism, and innovation, all while placing Armenian culture in the wider context of universal/global culture.
By using English as its primary language, h-pem will look to foster communication and interaction between the dispersed masses of Armenians and inspire a new generation of English-speaking Armenians to embrace their cultural heritage.
The use of Armenian as a fun and enjoyable language is also a part of h-pem’s greater mission.
H-Pem strives to:
H-Pem is a pan-Armenian initiative.
The Hamazkayin Armenian Cultural and Educational Society has undertaken the difficult yet necessary duty of creating and establishing this space ahead of an ever-growing wave of assimilation in the Armenian Diaspora.
We hope to build and foster a multi-layered, rich, and comprehensible platform, which can be the beginning of a cultural (re)awakening, especially in the Diaspora, where the need for regeneration and revival is more palpable now than ever before.
We invite you to become a part of the h-pem community and to spread the word about its mission.
Hamazkayin Launches “Levon Shant” Theatrical Ensemble in New Jersey
The Hamazkayin New Jersey chapter has occasionally put on a play but has never had a standing theatrical ensemble.
The most recent play was Adriana Sevahn Nichols’ Night Over Erzinga, which engaged the audience.
The chapter’s 2018 general assembly decided to build on that success and follow up with new plays, thus developing a standing theatrical ensemble.
The board formed a special committee.
The committee invited an experienced director, around whom a group of dedicated people with experience on the stage convened.
The new group, under the direction of Vartan Garniki, is named after the great playwright Levon Shant.
For its first show, the ensemble has selected two comedies.
The first is Gevorg Harutyunyan’s Shrtnerg tiv 4 (“Lipstick no. 4,”) which was made into a movie in Yerevan in the 1960s. The second is compiled by the director from articles published in Istanbul in the 1880s in Luys. It’s called Valsin vetserort vodke (“The sixth foot of the waltz”)
For the coming months, the ensemble has already planned to stage new plays.
We hope the new ensemble will continue its efforts and generate excitement and interest among the youth.

Hamazkayin organizes youth recitation event honoring Armenian mothers (Canada)
Inspired by the pontifical letter of His Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia, that declared 2013 as “the Year of the Armenian Mother,” Hamazkayin organized a recitation event dedicated to Armenian mothers.
The event was sponsored by writer and reciter Mrs. Azniv Torossian, who had arrived in Canada from Lebanon.
Children and youth, parents and grandparents, as well as a group of literary enthusiasts gathered at the Hamazkayin Theater of the Armenian Youth Center on Saturday, November 30, 2013 at 3:00 p.m. 
Two microphones were set up at the center of the stage, which was decorated with a painting by artist Puzant Godjamanian depicting a mother and a child.
Megheti Mnatsaganian and Varak Babian, members of the Literary Committee of Hamazkayin’s Klatsor Chapter, were the event hosts.
Reciting alternate lines from the poem “My Mother” by Hovhannes Shiraz, Megheti and Varak took the center of the stage to welcome the audience.
In her speech, Megheti said: From our numerous poems, it is obvious that throughout history Armenian mothers have not only been model parents, reflecting spiritual, ethical and national values, and have not only been strong pillars of their families and dedicated educators of their children, but they have also played an active, exemplary and respectable role in the most important moments of our history, demonstrating immense levels of self-sacrifice.
Varak explained that the event was not a contest; its aim was to bring together people who love poetry and recitation, in order to present a series of poems.
He added: we hope that these young people will continue loving their mother tongue and poems, becoming talented reciters in the future.
The more than 30 participants were students from elementary to high school classes.

Afterwards, Megheti Mnatsaganian invited to the stage Aren Mnatsaganian, the first-prize winner of the youth section of the writing contest organized by the Regional Committee of Hamazkayin in Canada, to recite his own poem “Mother.”
Megheti Mnatsaganian thanked all the participants and their teachers for their dedicated efforts. She announced that the creation of a recitation club is part of the upcoming plans of the Literary Committee which will ensure that high-quality recitations become a part of future events in the community. All participating students were rewarded with Armenian books.
Representative of the Literary Committee Eugenie Parseghian thanked the organizing committee and presented the event’s sponsor, Azniv Torossian.
Born in Beirut, Lebanon, Torossian has received her primary and secondary education at the AGBU Yervant Demirjian School and at the AGBU Taroushi Hagopian Secondary School for Girls, respectively.
She has started writing during her primary school years.
From an early age, she has loved the stage, has recited poems, and has received many prizes.
She is married to Melkon Torossian; they have four children and seven grandchildren.
Her first book of poems, “Pomegranates,” was published in 2008.
Her poems have also been published in Aztag Daily, Lebanon.
Eugenie invited Mrs. Torossian to the stage to thank her for her support. She also invited chairperson of the Klatsor Chapter of Hamazkayin, Lorig Katerdjian, to present a painting as a gift to the event’s sponsor.

These circumstances were challenges for the music school as well; however the defender of Armenian culture, Hamazkayin, fighting on the front lines, continues its struggle and its mission, believing that culture is the only way to secure future generations’ spiritual and intellectual stability and the maintenance of their Armenian character.

Hamazkayin Raffi and Anelga Arslanian Nursery School in Lebanon Delivers First Harvest
The Raffi and Anelga Arslanian Nursery School, opened festively on April 14, 2018, has already delivered its first harvest. On June 19, 2019, at its quarters in the new Armenian town of Dzaghgatzor, outside Beirut, the school held its first graduation ceremony.

She thanked the parents who had entrusted the school and its staff with their young children. The school had witnessed the children grow physically and mentally in an atmosphere and play and happiness.
Ms. Snabian stressed that the school did not aim to teach the alphabet and numbers; that’s for kindergarten. The aim is to develop basic skills that will help the children succeed in their social environment.
Play is the preferred way to teach children of this age; through play, children develop their imagination, their listening skills, their self-confidence, and their linguistic, physical, psychological, mental, and social life skills.
Hamazkayin Raises $25,000 at St. Illuminator’s for Educational Projects in Artsakh and Lebanon
His Eminence Archbishop Anoushavan Tanielian, Prelate, took part in the Divine Liturgy at St. Illuminator's Cathedral, where he delivered the sermon.
Following the Soorp Badarak, he presided over a special Fundraising Event and a Call for Solidarity at Pashalian Hall organized by Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society for its Children of Artsakh project, Armenian students at the Hamazkayin M. and H. Arslanian Djemaran in Lebanon, and the education of Armenian language teachers in Diasporan schools. A total of $25,000 was raised thanks to the generous donations of the public.
Rev. Fr. Mesrob Lakissian, Pastor, offered words of welcome and said with satisfaction that it was the first event the Church was hosting an event after the Covid pandemic, which marked a return to normal life.
He then invited Lalig Vartanian, of Hamazkayin's New York chapter; Maria Ebrimian, of the Armenian Relief Society's New York "Mayr" chapter; Tro Turbendian, of the local ARF Armen Garo Committee; Arevig Caprielian, chairwoman of Hamazkayin Eastern Region, and Ani Tchaghlasian, of ARF Eastern Region's Central Committee, to address the public.
In her talk, Mrs. Tchaghlasian also gave a slide show with an overview of life in Artsakh.
In turn, Archbishop Anoushavan praised highly this patriotic initiative organized by Hamazkayin, saying that its name sums up its mission.
"For some, the existence and dreams of the Armenian people are confined to Yerevan and its surroundings, at most a reduced Armenia, whereas for others they extend from California to Artsakh and from Artsakh to Australia," Archbishop Anoushavan said, as Hamazkayin in Armenian is a word that means "of the entire nation."
It is with this broader vision that encompasses the global Armenian nation that will lead to the greatness of the Diaspora and to support the Homeland, he said.
The Prelate also quoted from a story told by Mrs. Tchaghlasian in her talk, about a 10-year-old boy in Artsakh who was dancing in the schoolyard if he was not afraid as the mountain across from there was occupied and they were under permanent surveillance. Mrs. Tchaghlasian had asked him if he was not afraid, and the boy answered in the Artsakh dialect: "I know they are watching but let them know that we are not broken."
And with this quote His Eminence wrapped up his message, saying, "The words by this genuine son of the land of Artsakh not only must inspire us but the entire Armenian nation and have faith in the firm progress of our people in the Diaspora and the Homeland and the defense and conservation of our just rights."

Hamazkayin Tackles New Challenges
The everyday hum of life around the world has come to a standstill.
Nothing like this has happened before, at least not in our lifetimes.
Hamazkayin is adapting its activities to the circumstances and has quickly changed its mode of operation while remaining committed to its principles and vision, continuing its mission.
In the educational arena, in the early days of the pandemic, Hamazkayin schools—beginning with our Jemarans—moved to online instruction. The teacher-student connection is ongoing.
With the unstinting support and dedication of the administration, faculty, and staff of our schools, we are able to confront this challenge successfully.
We are, of course, well aware that new computer methods cannot fully replace the classroom experience; we try to achieve the best results within the limitations imposed by the circumstances. On this occasion, we thank the staff of our schools. The dedication they display is reminiscent of the dedication of Hamazkayin’s founding generation.
Indeed, this year is the 90th anniversary of the Jemaran founded by Levon Shant, Nigol Aghpalian, and their comrades; we are happy to see the heirs to these titans follow loyally in their footsteps.
The same can be said of Hamazkayin’s various regional educational and arts institutions.
This year is the fortieth anniversary of the Jemaran in Marseille.
In the midst of this upheaval, thanks to the efforts of the trustees, the facilities of the bilingual school became vested in Hamazkayin. The trustees are now preparing a plan to expand the school’s capacity.
In the future the Jemaran will be able to admit a larger number of students, addressing the growing demand in the region.
The Hamazkayin internet platform h-pem has been active for a year now, seeking to connect non-Armenian speaking young Armenians and non-Armenians to Armenian culture in its various manifestations.
During this time of isolation, h-pem is also adapting. 
The staff have reached out to specialists and artists in various areas to prepare video clips for the platform.
The platform is also trying to keep people’s spirits up with this content, mixing pleasure with benefit through culture.
Hamazkayin’s children’s “Lala and Ara” program is using its social media to allow Armenian children to see and hear from each other.
At the same time, it is adding educational content prepared by pedagogues. The first e-book featuring Lala and Ara was just released.
Meanwhile, Hamazkayin chapters around the world are using their online presence to slake our people’s thirst for culture, presenting high-quality performances and presentations.
Hamazkayin’s office in Armenia regularly puts Armenian films online; the Artsakh and Javakheti offices try to keep people connected with online showings and competitions.
Hamazkayin’s book distributors in Lebanon likewise organized a children’s drawing contest and a program to take books to people for no charge so they have something to read.
The e-library is available to the whole world and has new material available.
All of this continues thanks to the ongoing support of Hamazkayin’s volunteers and those who believe in the maintenance, dissemination, and development of Armenian culture.
As the examples above show, Hamazkayin continues to operate through some of the most challenging circumstances it has faced in its decades of existence.
In this time of physical distancing, we have not become isolated and atomized.
On the contrary, we are more connected than ever. We remain active and strong, capable of overcoming all the obstacles in our path.
Stay healthy.

Hamazkayin Youth Gather for a Meal in the Zavarian Hall in Greece
On March 16, 2019, an event hosted and organized by the Hamazkayin Greece dance committee was held in Kokinya Square’s Zavarian Center, in the Zakarian and Sarachian halls. The dinner party featured hearty tables and rich performances, enjoyed by nearly 300 guests. Upwards of eighty percent of those present were Armenian youth, who spent the evening rejoicing, singing, dancing, and further learning the traditions that they will pass on to the next generation. The expectations are high for the future of Hamazkayin, with a strong cultural identity, and a dream and vision of them continuing to always keep the spirit of what they have learned and passing it on again to the next generation of Armenians.
Months of preparation were put into this evening, to ensure that when it came it would run smoothly, be enjoyable, and seem as if making it happen was easy.
However, the entire dance committee—the chairperson, members, and dance ensemble members—worked with incredible persistence to create this event. Their only goal was to raise enough funds to refresh the dance ensemble’s wardrobe.

The concert, sponsored by the Armenian Genocide’s Centennial Committee of Canada and the "Sanahin" Chapter of Hamazkayin Toronto, in cooperation with "Gladzor" Chapter of Hamazkayin Canada, took place on Saturday, 21 November 2015, at 8 pm, at luxurious ″Marguerite Bourgeois″ Hall of ″Regina Assumpta″ College in Montreal. 
Prelate of the Armenian Prelacy of Canada, His Grace Bishop Meghrig Parikian and clerical fathers were among the guests. The head of “Folklore Canada″ Ki Lantri and his wife were also present at the event.
Tamar Shahinian delivered the opening speech in French and Armenian in the name of the Executive Board of “Sanahin" Chapter.
She thanked the Regional Executive Board of Hamazkayin Canada, which had initiated the unprecedented performance. It was the first joint concert of the dance troupes, and it will certainly have continuation. "Ani" Dance Ensemble will participate in the concert of "Erebuni" in Toronto soon.
Then, Chair of the Centennial Committee of Canada Mher Karakashian made a speech and said that our cause of recognition has turned into claims.
″We demand our occupied lands, retribution of rights and elimination of consequences″.
Mher Karakashian appreciated the Regional Executive Board of Hamazkayin Canada and thanked the Committees and ensembles saying, ″As long as more than ninety young people dance not only as representatives of culture, but also as Armenians, we shall certainly be able to defend the survivor generation’s rights and have united Armenia″.
The theme of the dances in the first part of the program was "The Flying Sorrow”. The artistic director of “Ani", Eva Hayrapetyan has been conducting the ensemble since 1995 always refreshing the repertoire of the ensemble with new dances.
"Ani" performed also modern dances reminding the nation’s sorrow such as "Abandonment ", "Do not take me away", "The Flying Sorrow", "Kochari", "Serenade", "Confession" "Inspiration" and "For the Souls of Dead ". All of those dances perfectly express the tragic past of our people but also leave hope for better future.
The performance was exceptional and the dancers’ professionalism was obvious.
Marie Hovhannisian’s self-confident and skillful dancing when she performed three solo dances was appreciable.
The expressive and symbolic dances expressed grief, inspiration and revival and were followed by the musical piece ″Lord, Have Mercy″ performed by a trio in a very impressive way, showing our people’s unyielding will and faith.
The costumes of the artists were accordant and exceptive.
After twenty minutes of break, during which the guests were treated, the "Erebuni" Dance Ensemble started its performance. The artistic director of the ensemble is Lori Najarian.
The theme of the second part was "Nation’s Spirit".
The Armenian dances " My Native Home", "Haykazuns", "Dele Yaman," "Tamzara", "Merik Merik", "Pomegranates’ Dance", "Cilicia", "Our Way" and "We are Armenians" thrilled and inspired the audience. 
The performance of the brave and intrepid dancers took us to our own native land, inspired us, and made us feel the Armenian spirit even far from homeland and on foreign shores.
Lori Najarian delivered a unique performance of "Pomegranates’ Dance".
The "Merik Merik" dance was the mix of modern and traditional.
During the performance of some dances, pictures of homeland were displayed on the screen hung above the stage.
The film telling about the history of the "Erebuni" Ensemble was also displayed on the screen.
At the end, Ms. Tamar Shahinian invited the Committee members, assistants, representatives of ″Gladzor″ and ″Sanahin″ Executive Boards and the two dance instructors to the stage. They received beautiful bouquets and ovation.
Holy Father made a speech and ended the unprecedented concert saying that the young Armenians’ dances prove that our nation will survive ever after. He encouraged the boys and girls saying, "You are our heroes of today, you are the flying up spirit of our nation".
Atom and Seda Malkhasians, whose grandfather Garabed Malkhasian was one of the founders of the Hamazkayin Society, and whose all family members actively participate in the life of Hamazkayin, donated ten thousand dollars to the Society strongly believing that our dances have noble mission, and they serve to the Armenian Cause.
Right after the concert, both troupes were invited to the Armenian Center by the Executive Board of “Sanahin" Chapter to take part in the regale, which lasted until morning.
The joyful party once again showed the Hamazkayin great family’s unity spirit and optimism.

Hamazkayin “Artsakh” Dance School and “Erepuni” Dance Ensemble Hold Annual Performance in Canada
Lately I came across these words of sculptor Zaven Khdeshian in Hamazkayin’s Pakin literary journal: “A true work of art shakes the beholder in a mere tenth of second.”
Over the weekend of 22–23 June, 2019, the Hamazkayin “Artsakh” Dance School and “Erepuni” Dance Ensemble held their annual performance. The dances were staged wonderfully. The movements were harmonious and synchronized. The costumes were rich. The music, lighting, and decor were coordinated. Thus, from the first split second, the viewer’s thoughts and spirits took flight toward beauty and gentle creation.
The red velvet curtain separates us from the next moment.
The lights dim, the side conversations go quiet, and all at once the cymbals clash and the sounds of “Yerevan-Erebuni” fill the hall. It hits me in the gut.
While the music continues, heads turn toward the back. Through both doors of the Hamazkayin theater, girls in pomegranate costumes are entering, bearing candleholders in both hands.
The curtains open gently to reveal the logo of the Erepuni dance ensemble and banners depicting stone sculptures.
The smooth and radiant steps on the stage transport us to the homeland of light.
And we hear the zurna. It is Ara Kevorkian’s Artdashad, inviting Erepuni to dance, coming forward with joyful and confident movements, assuring us once more that “nothing will defeat the old nation that knows to dance with such toil and such will.”
Maria Karageozian, on behalf of the Hamazkayin Toronto Chapter Executive Board, says words of welcome. Then Group A of the younger students of the Artsakh dance school begin their performance. The “chicks” awaken from their slumbers, wearing yellow skirts, taking synchronized, tiny steps, moving their fingers, and with their smiling eyes, capture our hearts.
Then the older group. The “cranes,” led by their mother crane, make gentle motions with their fingers, take smooth steps, and occupy the stage. I recall Emin: “whichever way you looked, you dug it.”
Next up is Group C of the younger students. The “Kintos” are bold, wrapped in ornate raincoats; their steps are joyful and their faces are expressive.
After the “Kintos,” violinist Hovhannes Mubayed greets us with “Black Eyes” greet us. The memories burst open and we travel to the dream world of “Husher” alongside the Erepuni and Artsakh older girls, who perform superbly. 
From Erepuni, David Manoukian and Hrag Karamardian perform “Zurni Drnki” with staccato movements.
For a moment we leave the Armenian world; longtime Erepuni member Lana Der Bedrossian is on the stage and her lively Spanish dancing impresses the audience.
With radiant faces, Group B of the younger students takes the stage. They promise a florid “Karun” (Spring). Warmed up by the spring sun, what can we relate to the most if not our “Kochari”?
Erepuni is back on stage. With masculine moves, girls and boys shake the hall, and the applause at the end shakes it further.
The scent of spring continues with the gentle presentation of “Paleni” (Sour cherry tree). Teen Group B is up now, with red, florid costumes the proud sour cherry tree grabs the attention of the audience. Then the older group performs the celebratory “Donagan bar” and brings celebratory joy to the hall.
The solo performers in “Davigh,” Vanie Yaacoubian, Mariya Manoukian, and Lana Der Bedrossian are glorious. The staging is so tasteful and delicate, we are awed.
Teen Group A generates joy with “Gadag bar” and continues it with “Sureru bar,” performed by Mr. Mubayed.
Soon, we are in the land of Mogs, its brides, “Mogats harser” come out.
With a weighty and regal look, proud eyes, and miraculously beautiful costumes, the older girls of Erepuni and Artsakh take the stage. Rubina Sarkisian has a solo.
The music ramps up with the ever-popular “Shalakho.” The soloist is Meghedi Gosdanian, covered in vortan red.
In “Akhltskha” too we see the proud and determined Armenian woman, in a velvet costume, with restrained movements, performed by Mariya Manoukian on Saturday and Ms. Der Bedrossian on Sunday.
We go now from Javakhk (which encompasses Akhltskha) to heroic Karabagh, where the Erepuni boys and soloist Dzila Kourjakian, wearing a velvet, gold-embroidered costume, conveys the spirit of Artsakh (Karabagh) to the audience.
With Ms. Karageozian’s closing words, the program comes to an end.
One hundred thirty dancers come on stage and receive warm applause. The members of Erepuni receive special appreciation.
Audience members are on their feet.
Behind any successful initiative there are hard-working hands, of course. In this instance, the executive board representative, the dance committee, the supervisors of the various groups, and the stage crew all deserve thanks. A special thank you goes to the artist Ara Ter Haroutunian, who was responsible for set design.
There is probably much that can be written about the talented, accomplished dance instructor, artistic director, and director Nelly Karapetyan, to whom we are indebted for the success of this high-quality performance. Her firm and unwavering commitment to high quality is plain to see.
One of the qualities of the adroit teacher is her ability to bring out the best in her students.
Faced with all the congratulations, she can modestly say, “I did nothing.” She means this is the first step, and having enjoyed the early fruits, we can await much more.

Hamazkayin “Gargach” Children’s Choir Holds Annual Concert in Beirut
At the initiative of the Hamazkayin Regional Executive Board for Lebanon, in cooperation with the American University of Beirut, on May 19, 2019, at the university’s Assembly Hall, the “Gargach” Children’s Choir held its annual concert. The choir was directed and conducted by Zakar Keshishian and accompanied on piano by Liana Harutyunian and Lusy Krouzian.
The concert was dedicated to the 150th anniversary of the birth of Gomidas and Hovhannes Tumanian. Over the course of its 22 years, the choir has had more than 900 members. It presented a program of Armenian folk and composed music.
The youth choir also sang “Beledi Lubnen el amr” in Arabic. The song, by Zaki Nasifi was especially arranged for “Gargach” by Dr. Edward Torigian.
Hamazkayin “Kasbar Ipegian” Theater Group Performs in Armenia
On June 10–13, 2019, the Hamazkayin “Kasbar Ipegian” Theater Group performed Neil Simon’s comedy The Good Doctor in Armenia under the direction of Hagop Der-Ghoukassian
The play was presented in Gyumri at the V. Achemyan State Drama Theater, in Vanadzor at the Hovhannes Abelyan State Drama Theater, and in Yerevan at the Hamazkayin Sos Sargsyan State Theater.
Members of the Ipegian Theater consider cooperation with counterparts in Armenia to be important and are confident that the ties will lend greater vitality to theater in Armenia and Lebanon alike. Cooperation allows players from Armenia to show their talents in other countries.
The burden is on diaspora communities to create a market for theatrical groups from Armenia to make possible the financial and cultural results sought.
Cooperation naturally also helps Lebanese-Armenian theater and viewers to be enriched with high-quality theater with different taste and sensibilities.
This may help raise the level of Armenian theater in Lebanon. It can also lead to friendships in the two theatrical worlds.
Hamazkayin “Knar” Dance Ensemble Participates in Komotini Festival in Greece

The ensembles and their entourage were received warmly by Archbishop Kegham Khatcherian, Primate of the Armenian Diocese of Greece.
Hamazkayin “Lucy Tutunjian” Art Gallery Hosting Ashot Avagyan’s Exhibition (Lebanon)
The exhibition of native artist Ashot Avagyan’s paintings opened on Friday, July 17, 2015 at 6:00 pm, at the Hamazkayin’s "Lucy Tutunjian" Art Gallery. The displayed unique artistic style of native art had created a completely different atmosphere on both floors of the gallery. The sponsors of the event were the Hamazkayin Members, spouses Mr. and Mrs. Adom and Sella Tnchukians. The huge number of guests gathered at the opening ceremony included the Hamazkayin members arrived from the United States, Canada and Europe, as well as the Hamazkayin’s donors, friends, art lovers and artists.
Suzy Derderian delivered the opening speech of the event.
She briefly introduced the artist, the paintings of which authentically reflect his native land and the magic of the Armenian rocks and nature.
Derderian also mentioned that the presence of the sponsors and of the huge number of other Hamazkayin members arrived from different Armenian communities speaks about the significant nationwide role played by the Hamazkayin "Lucy Tutunjian" Art Gallery.
Hamazkayin “Parsegh Ganachian” Conservatory Celebrates 35 Years with Instructors’ Concert
On December 4, the instructors of the Hamazkayin “Parsegh Ganachian” Conservatory performed at the Armenian Evangelical Church in Beirut in a concert to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the music school. The event was held under the auspices of the Archbishop Nareg Alemezian, Prelate of Armenians in Lebanon and organized by Hamazkayin Art Schools.
Vahram Emmiyan, director of the conservatory, spoke in Armenian and English. He said the celebration of the 35th anniversary meant celebrating the memory and contributions of the founders, members of the successive boards of directors and boards of trustees, former directors and instructors, many of whom are no longer living—but the fruits of their loving labor remain vibrant.
Mr. Emmiyan said the conservatory was established during the Lebanese Civil War, when buildings and institutions were being destroyed, people were getting killed, chaos reigned. It began in a time of uncertainty, and continues its mission at a time of economic warfare.
The Hamazkayin “Parsegh Ganachian” Conservatory continues to work toward enriching and developing the spiritual and intellectual world of the new generation.
“Yes, we know well, that not all of our students will become professional musicians; but we also know that skilled musicians need skilled listeners. Listeners who can tells what is good and what isn’t; what is beautiful and what isn’t; what is valuable and what isn’t. Listeners who have a cultivated ear.
This is the mission that the school has been pursuing for 35 years now,” Mr. Emmiyan concluded, noting that a torch had been passed.
Hamazkayin “Sanahin” Chapter Welcomes the New Year in Montreal
On January 12, 2019, at the Avetis Aharonian Hall of the Armenian Centre in Montreal, some 200 Hamazkayin members and supporters gathered in a warm atmosphere to celebrate the arrival of the new year.
Chapter Executive Board chairwoman Tamar Chahinian, speaking for the board, welcomed the guests and opened the program.
She thanked everyone—employees or committee members, members of the choir, dance ensemble, theatre company, book program, the M. Ishkhan library, the chidren’s story hour, or the Hamazkayin Clubs—for the support they provided over the past year to all Hamazkayin initiatives.
She noted that Hamazkayin lives and transmits Armenian culture and education thanks to the public, thanks to dedicated people who take on responsibility voluntarily.
Ms. Chahinian awarded the person responsible for the book program, Rakel Demirjian, with a certificate of appreciation.
After reading Ms. Demirjian’s biography, Ms. Chahinian reflected on her fruitful activity and said, “Hamazkayin is proud to have Rakel and other members like her in its family; they embody our mission to keep Armenian literature alive as well as the spirit of voluntarism.
It would be hard to find a member of the Hamazkayin family quite as dedicated, quite as faithful and self-sacrificing; for over twenty years, every Sunday, without fail, at the entrance of the Aharonian hall, she sets up our little bookstore. This is an expression of her priorities and her sense of duty.”
The celebration was well attended by young people. Karekin Gyuryunlian and Arpi Soghomonian recited poetry. Laura Berberian, Anita Tobi, and Flora Artinian sang solos.
Two games organized by Adom Malkhasian generated much excitement: the best snowperson and racing with balloons.
During the evening, a group sharing a table created an impromptu chorus and performed the Santa Claus song under the baton of Adom Malkhasian. Then the Knar Choir performed Yerevan-Erebuni.
A cake was cut to celebrate two performances, over the past year: the Knar Choir’s recital and the staging of The Tower of Babel by the Bedros Atamian theatre company.
Then Levon Kaprielian shared his talent in comedy and theater, presenting a monologue titled “Old and New Cuisine.”
The two Ani dance ensembles performed.
Raffle tickets were sold and many people made donations to help cover the expenses for the event.
The evening continued in the warm spirit of fellowship, with laughter and games, kef and dance.
The Armenian new year, according to tradition, is to be greeted like this.
Attendees left the hall in good cheer and with a sense of gratitude for their membership in the great Hamazkayin family.

Hamazkayin “Sayat Nova” Choir Performs in Southern California
On May 4, 2019, we were witness to a miracle at the Pasadena First Church of Nazarene.
The miracle maker was the Hamazkayin Western United States “Sayat Nova” Choir, accompanied by an equally miraculous symphonic orchestra.
The two groups were conducted by Mikayel Avetisyan.
The evening was a new summit in the artistic life of the Southern California Armenian community thanks to the almost errorless and professional-level performance of the amateur musicians led by Mr. Avetisyan and music director Gayane Baghdasaryan.
The concert marked the sesquicentennial of the birth of Gomidas and a decade of activity for the choir. Bishop Torkom Donoyan, Vicar General of the Armenian Prelacy, priests, representatives of the ARF Central Committee and the ARF Pasadena “Lernavayr” Gomideh, the Hamazkayin central, regional, and chapter executive boards, and hundreds of music lovers were in attendance. They enjoyed two full hours of Armenian classical, national-revolutionary, and folk music. The movement between genres seemed effortless.
The evening began with an impressive and unprecedented work of performance art featuring Grand Stage Dance Studio students staging Gomidas’s “Oror” (Lullaby). The author of the work was Ms. Baghdasaryan.
It was a brilliant idea; from the first moment, it electrified the atmosphere, connected the stage and the audience, gave wings to Gomidas’s breath, raised the tide of spirits of the audience members, and filled the hall with an Armenian soul.
A group of students became exceptional interpreters of the important moments in Gomidas’s life; interwoven with the lullaby was the story of the national catastrophe and mourning, Gomidas’s reality and imagination. The soloist was the celebrated soprano Liliana Natalie Buickians, a recent graduate of the doctoral program at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York.
After the performance art, the concert continued with Gomidas’s “National Anthem,” which inspired the performance of the 48 adult members of the choir.
They performed “Gomidasian” (arranged by Suren Khachadurian), “Naro Jan” (Parsegh Ganachian), “Ov hayots ashkharh: (Magar Yegmalian), “Yeraz im yergir” (Robert Amirkhanyan), and “Markardashar” (Ruben Altounian).

Hamazkayin’s h-pem presented at Toronto Klatsor chapter meeting
TORONTO—H-Pem’s editor and content manager, Rupen Janbazian, gave an illustrated presentation about the Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society’s online cultural platform at the Hamazkayin Toronto Klatsor Chapter’s “Face-to-Face” monthly membership meeting on Feb. 5, 2020.
About 50 chapter members were given a detailed look into the web-based platform, which strives to foster cultural appreciation through participation and communication, especially among Armenian Diasporan youth. After providing an overview of the conception, creation, and launch of the project, Janabzian exhibited the website along with all of its features and sections. The meeting participants, many of whom are active users of the platform, were enthusiastic about h-pem and its mission.
Following the comprehensive presentation, the floor was opened to participants, during which several insightful questions and comments were directed to Janbazian.
Launched and made available to the public in May 2019, h-pem's mission is to reach Armenian communities around the world and help Armenians—particularly Armenian youth—(re)connect with their homeland and culture in new, creative, and cooperative ways.
The Toronto chapter of Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society was established in 1969.
Since its inception, the Toronto Chapter of Hamazkayin has grown to become a vibrant presence in the community, with over 200 active members and volunteers throughout its various committees.
Hamazkayin’s h-pem spotlighted at ARS Youth Connect Program at Yale University
The Armenian Relief Society’s (ARS) biannual Youth Connect Program took place at Yale University on Saturday, Nov. 4, 2019.
Many lectures, presentations, and panel discussions were held throughout the one-day event, with topics ranging from proteins and satellites to Middle Eastern politics and religious minorities in Turkey.
Before presenting, h-pem Assistant Project Manager Lilly Torosyan was introduced to a group of young Armenians whose backgrounds were anything but conventional: a medical student in the Caribbean, originally from Toronto, now living in Connecticut; a mixed-race engineering student at Brown University, who spoke unaccented Eastern Armenian; a PhD nursing student who arrived from Lebanon to the East coast just a few years ago; and a graduate student of Education from Syria.
And this wasn’t even 10 percent of the attendees, who numbered north of 60 college-aged students from all across the United States and Canada.
She then called on the audience to get involved by joining h-pem as active users and submitting content and/or becoming ambassadors.
Though time did not allow for questions, following the presentation, several participants approached Torosyan to share their excitement for such a new resource, which taps into their Armenian identities in creative ways.
One young man from New York state, who professed to be detached from the Armenian community at large, could hardly contain his excitement with the platform’s aims and motivations.
“Finally, a site I want to visit, to engage with, and learn more about—my Armenian identity!” he exclaimed.
Another young man expressed a similar sentiment later on that evening.
Many participants seemed particularly engaged with h-pem’s diverse and welcoming approach to the concepts of identity and belonging, perhaps relating on a personal level with their own diverse backgrounds.
Two individuals, at different points throughout the program, stated that they heard about the site from their friend, Garin Bedian, an h-pem ambassador from Chicago.
One individual suggested submitting artistic content for h-pem; another sat with Torosyan and began discussing article ideas.
Overall, the day proved to be fruitful and promising for h-pem.
“It was a pleasure to meet such talented, dynamic young Armenians, and I look forward to seeing through the many discussions that arose, as well as spreading the word about h-pem to young Armenians in other regions, as well,” says Torosyan.

The performance was organized by the group’s executive members and came about through the work of the married couple Garen and Jaklin Makinian. The group performed three kinds of dance, which exhibited their unique character. It combined and encompassed Armenian folk, non-Armenian cultures, and contemporary dance. These elements, combined, took the audience into all kinds of cultural worlds.
Twenty-three young dancers shook the Ivoire stage with their group dances, such as “Karoun Yerevan.” Armenia’s folk artist Norayr Mehrabian staged the dances “Zartonk” and “Pert Bar.” The program also featured duets and solos.
The group’s impressive repertoire included the light-hearted “Drekhner” duet in which the soloists, Sarine Margosian and Sebu Torikian, told the story of a village woman asking her husband for a city woman’s shoes.
It was engaging to watch the development of the story in the staging by these talented and lithesome dancers.
It was fascinating to watch Lori Tzarukian and Garen Mahtesian transporting us to a different time in “Timag.” “Gisherayin” is the story of a love triangle that plays out by a fountain, portrayed by Tigran Zanian, Kali Khudaverdian, and Lori Kantartjian.
“Groong,” performed by Karina Hansehian and Ashot Abgarian, movingly recounted of the story of the crane.

Hamazkayin’s Steps Up Cooperation with Istanbul’s Armenian Communities
The Central Executive Board of Hamazkayin continues to strengthen the organization’s ties with the Armenian communities in Istanbul.

She presented to the communities Hamazkayin’s children’s and youth programs. This trip strengthened the partnership between Hamazkayin and the Armenians of Turkey.
Ms. Kalousdian’s visit followed on a visit in late February, 2018, of two teachers from the Ortaköy Tarkmancas (Holy Translators’) School, Jermen Kantarcıoğlu and Talar Koseoglu, who travelled to Beirut and, over the course of five days, visited all the departments of Hamazkayin’s M. & H. Arslanian Djemaran. They familiarized themselves with the Armenian language program, teaching methods, and textbooks and had a chance to speak at length with the teachers.

In the evenings, the visitors had opportunities to further bond with the teachers, as they visited Lebanese-Armenian and Lebanese sites around the country.
The Central Executive Board finds visits in both directions helpful. The visits are opportunities for communities to enrich each other and strengthen each other.
We should add that two young people from Istanbul have applied to participate in Hamazkayin’s Armenian school teacher and school administrator training programs.
With all its riches and Armenian schools, Istanbul has been a major part of the Hamazkayin Central Executive Board’s work in recent years. The board hopes that these ties will be reinforced in the future and practical cooperation will continue.

Hamazkayin’s “M. & H. Arslanian” Djemaran Graduates’ “Peno Tontian” Generation Reception
The reception of the 2013-2014 academic year graduates took place on Saturday, 7 March 2015, at "Chalian" Hall of "M. & H. Arslanian" Djemaran.
Alumni Association Board member Aram Somounjian introduced the activities of the Association to the new generation, after which each graduate introduced himself, his chosen profession or the sphere of his career to the audience.
Then, the new generation’s godfather, Central Executive Board Chairman Mgrdich Mgrdichian was invited to make a speech.
"Today is a special day for the graduates of Djemaran.
With this formal and modest ceremony, the graduates of the last academic year will join the Djemaran Alumni Association.
I am invited to talk on this occasion, and I would like to welcome you in the Djemaran Alumni Association."
"In a movie, which humorously describes the life of the Greek community in the diaspora, the hero - a Greek traditionalist father, believes that the world consists of two groups of people. The first are the Greeks, and the second are the rest of the humanity who would like to be Greek born.
Similarly, in our Armenian surrounding, there exists an opinion that the world consists of the seminarians and the rest, which dream about being seminarians. However, if there exists also a third group, then it is probably its own fault.
Is it true?
Of course not, but the story does not end there, because at the same time, those in the second group have their special opinion about the seminarians.
They seriously think that the Djemaran students are spoiled, selfish, boastful and arrogant and they consider themselves and their institution the hub of the universe.
Is this opinion correct?
Of course not, but in such opinion or a joke there is a grain of objective truth.
What is the grain of that truth, which is actually based upon a good number of positive features, the negative interpretation of which makes such an impression on the outer world?"
Hamazkayin’s “Master and Servant” Received Well in the U.S.
Anyone keeping an eye on the life of the Burbank, Calif., Armenian community is aware that the Hamazkayin Theater Unit has maintained an annual tradition for several years and spares no effort to build on it. 
The unit stages at least one play a year. The target audience is children and teens of school age. The purpose is to encourage in them a love of theater and a commitment to it. Their elders are not left out either.
In mid-February, the unit offered up Dern u Dzaran (The master and the servant), a musical comedy based on Hovhannes Tumanian’s story bearing the same title.
Hamazkayin’s “Timag” Theater Group Presents Tahmazian’s “Ngarin Yergu Goghme” in Cyprus
On December 15, 2019, over 200 community members attended a performance of Harut Tahmazian’s “Ngarin Yergu Goghme” (Both sides of the picture), performed by the Hamazkayin’s Oshagan Chapter’s “Timag” Theater Group. Tahmazian wrote the screenplay for the play, a satire, and directed the production.
The performance was very funny, and held up to the high expectations of the community members, set with anticipation as two guests from Lebanon, the actor Pier Shammasian and the well-loved actress Seda Lepejian performed. Both were specifically chosen by the Tahmazian for this production.
The theater group, Timag, is composed of performers of many ages and levels of experience. However, all of them played their roles to perfection. Shammasian’s role was small, but memorable, and his presence inspired the others.
The evening was dedicated to Adiss Harmandian’s memory, whose songs were used in the production.
After the performance, the Oshagan Chapter celebrated it with a dinner.
The chapter’s president, Arto Davitian, in his speech, thanked everyone present, not forgetting those who did the unglamorous behind-the-scenes work.
Hamo Sahian discussed at second gathering of the book club of Hamazkayin (Canada)
On March 18, 2012 at 2:30 PM the Klatsor Chapter of Hamazkayin held its second book club gathering. The session was dedicated to Armenian poet Hamo Sahian (1914-1993.)
I was delighted by looking around. This month as well, and in spite of the very pleasant weather outside, around fifty book-lovers attended the gathering. Moreover, among them were a dozen young people.
A while later it became clear that unlike Vahan Derian, Hamo Sarian was unknown to many. This was a good opportunity for the audience to get acquainted with the prominent writer from Armenia and his work. After a brief introduction, Megheti Mnatsaganian took the stage.
Ms. Mnatsaganian was born in Toronto. Until the eighth grade, she attended the Armenian school of the Armenian Relief Society.
She completed her higher education at the University of Toronto, where she acquired a teaching diploma. Now she teaches elementary classes.
Megheti grew up in an Armenian family that lives with the Armenian national spirit, and has taken part in literary events organized by Hamazkayin. After mentioning that Hamo Sahian is one of her favorite poets, Megheti features the poet’s life. Sahian was born in the Lor village of Sisian, now in the region of Syunik.
He graduated from the University of Pedagogy of Baku. He published several volumes of poetry, such as “Nayirian talar pardi” (“Green poplar tree of Nayiree land,”) “Seasam patsvir” (“Open seasam,”) “Kare Badarak” (“Stone liturgy,”) and “Indz patsaga chtnek” (“Don’t mark me as absent.”)He was a very modest person and his personality is well expressed in his poetry.
In his last years Sahian lived in poverty, similar to many other poets.
He has contributed to numerous newsletters and has translated several books.
With his unique writing style Sahian mainly wrote about the human being and the nature of the fatherland.
Copies of Sahian’s poems selected by Megheti were handed out to the audience, giving them an opportunity to participate in the discussion.
The selected poems were divided into three sections: patriotic, such as “Hayasdan aselis” (“When saying Armenia,”) “Karount hayeren e kalis” (“Your spring comes in Armenian,”) and poetry rich in sentimentality, such as “G kam” (“I will come.”)
Several videos were presented and in one of them Hamo Sahian himself was reciting “Hayasdan aselis.”
Megheti and other participants presented other poems by Sahian and gradually other topics, such as undying faith in the eternity of the Armenian people.
Another topic is how Sahian embraces life and his positive approach towards it. Hovhannes Aivazian, the editor of the volume “Kare Badarak,” has described him as someone who “lives and gives life.”
In her presentation Megheti Mnatsaganian also draws parallels between the works of Sahian and Vahakn Davtian.
Toward the end of the event Alin Donabedian, the chairperson of the Klatsor chapter of Hamazkayin, thanked Megheti for her high quality presentation, as well as the audience, for their encouragement and appreciation.
Then she announced the chapter’s upcoming events.
In appreciation of their work, Megheti Mnatsaganian and Razmig Mnatsaganian received copies of a volume of a selection of poems by Hamo Sahian and Vahakn Davtian, published by the Central Committee of Hamazkayin.
Afterwards and around coffee and cakes, the attendees shared their impressions on Sahian.
“I am very happy that Hamazkayin is organizing such events, giving us, the youth, an opportunity to read and research the work of Armenian writers.
Thanks to the presentation, I learnt a lot about Hamo Sahian.
It was very encouraging to see young people, who, encouraged by this event will join the book club of Hamazkayin. I will leave the gathering with only positive emotions,” said Megheti.
The next gathering will be dedicated to the poet Siamanto, one of the victims of the Armenian Genocide.

Hasmik Papyan and Harout Fazlian charm elite Lebanese Armenians (Lebanon)
Organized and initiated by the Regional Committee of Hamazkayin in Lebanon and the cultural committee of AGBU, a unique cultural event took place on Thursday, April 12, 2012, at 8:00 PM. World renowned soprano Hasmik Papyan and acclaimed Lebanese-Armenian conductor Harout Fazlian performed together.
The event was sponsored by Mr. and Mrs. Hovig and Maral Kurkjian and commenced without opening speeches or national anthems: the entrance of Maestro Harout Fazlian to the stage and his bow implied the start to the evening.
With an intermission of ten minutes, the duo’s concert with the accompaniment of the National Symphonic Orchestra of Lebanon spanned over two hours and enchanted the audience of Lebanese and Lebanese-Armenian attendees.
The atmosphere was extremely impressive as the audience included members of the parliament, the minister of state, ambassadors, academicians, educators, spiritual leaders, community activists, and representative of national organizations.
Soprano Papyan, the holder of several international honors, carried away the audience with her incredible voice to the world of the titans of classical music, such as Aram Khachatouryan, Gomidas, Arno Papajanyan, Parsegh Ganachian, Vincenzo Bellini, Cylia, Verdi, and others. The audience was enchanted and its absolute silence was interrupted only by the applause upon the arrival of Papyan and Fazlian to the stage.
“Oror” (“Lullaby”) was especially moving: it channeled a greeting to Armenian mothers, an emotional track that evoked memories of the blessed ancestral home of Armenians, and where the words of blessing hummed by a mother to her child are always heard.
The 25th anniversary of Papyan’s talents was not forgotten by the organizing committee.
The artist, who has received multiple honors, merits, and medals was honored once again, along with Maestro Fazlian and the National Symphonic Orchestra of Lebanon.
On this occasion, a Letter of Appreciation was conveyed by the RL Minister of Culture Gabi Layoun, who had expressed pride and thankfulness on behalf of the Lebanese nation for the opportunity to host Papyan on the Lebanese stage.
Similarly, RA Minister of Culture Hasmik Poghosyan, RA Minister of Diaspora Hranush Hakobyan, and Ashot Kocharyan, the Ambassador of Armenia to Lebanon congratulated the artist with special letters of acknowledgement.
This all was culminated with a letter of blessing from Catholicos Aram I, read by Archbishop Gomidas Ohanian. After honoring Papyan with a Mesrob Mashdots medal in 2004, the Catholicos once again acknowledged the exceptional artist.
Toward the end of the evening, Armen Eurneshlian on behalf of AGBU and Silva Kurkjian, on behalf of Hamazkayin thanked the audience, the performers, and especially Hovig and Maral Kurkjian, who had sponsored the event.
Ms. Kurkjian then read the greetings from the RA Ministers of Culture and Diaspora, and concluded the event by a closing speech in English.

Herand Markarian Celebrated at Eighty
The 65th anniversary of Herand Markarian’s cultural activity and his eightieth birthday were celebrated at the historic Queens Theatre on October 19, 2019, in the presence of a large multitude.
The event enjoyed blessings from His Holiness Karekin II, Catholicos of All Armenians, and His Holiness Aram, Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia. It was held under the auspices of the Ambassador of the Republic of Armenia in Washington and the Central Executive Board of Hamazkayin.
The Hamazkayin Regional Executive Board for the Eastern United States and the New York Chapter Executive Board supported and participated in the event. Representatives of the following organizations participated in this event, which had a pan-national character: Diocese of the Armenian Church of America (Eastern); Eastern Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic Church; Central Committee of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Eastern Region, U.S.A.; Central Executive of the Armenian Democratic Liberal Party; Regional Executive Board of the Armenian Relief Society, Eastern Region USA and New York Mayr Chapter Executive Board; Esayan Alumni Association; Knights of Vartan; Areni Choir; Hairenik Weekly; Armenian Weekly; and Baikar Weekly.
Dr. Markarian’s legacy had been celebrated in Yerevan on May 31 and June 3, 2019, at the initiative of the Hamazkayin Yerevan Office, the Writers’ Union of Armenia, and the Diaspora Ministry.
People with strict artistic standards agreed on adjectives like “unique,” “unprecedented,” “outstanding,” “soul-nourishing,” and “miraculous” to describe the event.
Successful events are often described as “professional”; the overwhelming majority of participants testified in person, through emails, and through phone calls that this event was professional in content, in terms of innovation, and in its implementation.
The event began with the three emcees asking all to rise to listen to bulls issued by the catholicoses.
Rev. Fr. Vazken Karayan read the bull from Karekin II; Very Rev. Fr. Sahag Yemishian, Vicar General of the Eastern Prelacy, read the bull from Aram.
The audience seated, Hrayr Baronian, a member of the Hamazkayin Central Executive Board, read that board’s message; Khachig Choukhajian read the New York Chapter Executive Board’s message.
The first unusual staging of the event came to light when the three proficient emcees, Veh Bezdikian, Natalie Gabrielian, and Yeraz Markarian, took the stage from both sides, saying “Good evening! You are welcome!” connecting the audience to the stage.
The program had begun!
The trio invited us to travel along the lanes of Herand Markarian’s life....
An exceptional movie, Ughevore (The traveler), was shown. It focused on four stages in Dr. Markarian’s life: his birthplace of Margil, Basra, Iraq; his youth in Baghdad; his adulthood in the United States; and the crowning glory, Armenia.
In the 35-minute film, we saw and heard Markarian the intellectual, the Armenian, the ARMENIAN in capital letters, with his worldview, his worries....
The film was made in Armenia.
Artur Mkrtichyan was the author; Artur Babyan, the director; and Artur Ordoyan, the cinematographer.
Then, on the large screen, a picture of Khrimian Hayrik appeared....
With two walking sticks drumming the stage rhythmically, in came a man costumed as Khrimian.
In ten minutes, Dr. Markarian reprised his role, offering Khrimian’s unforgettable call to arms after his experience at the Congress of Berlin, 1878: other nations had come to the conference with iron ladles to take their share of the harissa the great powers were handing out; all Khrimian had was a petition, a paper ladle that crumpled in the cauldron.
The emcees than listed the many Armenian and non-Armenian organizations with which or for which Dr. Markarian had performed.
We entered the innovative world of Dr. Markarian’s artistic creativity. For the first time, we heard three songs composed on Dr. Markarian’s poetry: “Mangutiun” (Childhood), “Hayasdan” (Armenia), and “Dzaghradzun” (The clown).
The lyrics and music of the first two were by Dr. Markarian. The music for the third was by Berge Turabian.
Soloist Anahid Zakarian was invited to the stage. A graduate of the Komitas Conservatory in Yerevan, she leads the New York Saint Illuminator Cathedral Choir. Under an image of a recumbent child, she performed “Mangutiun.”
Mr. Turabian then took the stage. Known for his performance of songs by Aznavour, strumming a guitar, he gave an idiosyncratic interpretation of the complex world inhabited by Dr. Markarian’s poetry.
Arsen Gevorgyan, a young baritone from Armenia, sang “Hayasdan,” accompanied by Professor Margarita Sargsyan on piano.
A picture of the Mother Armenia statute was on the screen.
Elizabeth Khodabashian and Lucyn Djirdjirian, longtime collaborators of Dr. Markarian’s on the stage, read “Hayasdan” as a duet.
Two theatrical scenes were presented. The first, from Dr. Markarian’s play, Soghomon Tehlirian, was Soghomon’s monologue addressed to his mother.
Toros Tervizian played Soghomon, while Ms. Gabrielian, the emcee, played the mother in this emotionally fraught scene.
The second was from Dr. Markarian’s Vartanank. Mr. Bezdikian, the emcee, performed Vartan’s monologue.
Next up were Hagop Vartivarian, an editor of Baikar; Harutiun Missirlian; Dr. George Der Meskhian; and poet Vehanoush Tekian.
They spoke about Dr. Markarian’s work.
Then, by video, Professor Richard Hovannisian praised Dr. Markarian’s loyal and unwavering commitment to Hamazkayin.
He was amazed how Dr. Markarian had created a play out of his first book, Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918 (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1967).
Vahe Balouzian, Chairperson of the Armenian Medical Fund, USA, speaking via video, praised Dr. Markarian’s work over more than twenty years as executive secretary of the fund.
An eight-minute film titled, “Yes Artsakhn em” (I am Artsaskh), was shown.
At the conclusion of the program, the emcees invited the honoree to take the stage.
After a stirring standing ovation, he asked all the participants to join him on the stage.
He then asked his wife, Dr. Janet Mouradian, to join him, labeling her his “number-one critic.”
All donations on the occasion of Dr. Markarian’s anniversary are allocated in full to the soldiers defending the front lines of Armenia and Artsakh, the care of wounded soldiers, and the education of the children of martyred soldiers.
Donations may be sent to the nonprofit Libra-6 Productions, Inc., 160 Waters Edge, Congers, NY 10920.
A memorial book has been published on the occasion. It includes the catholicoses’ bulls and messages from spiritual, political, cultural, charitable, social organizations and public intellectuals.
Donations made through the date of the event are acknowledged.
The book includes a condensed version of Dr. Markarian’s cultural legacy.
We congratulate, from the heart, our chapter’s accomplished, shining member, Unger Herand, for the fruits of his labor dedicated to the Armenian people, his commitment to the organization, and his endless support.
We wish him good health, a long life and new adventures.
Go in peace, Unger Herand.

Historian Claude Mutafian speaks in Paris on Armenians in Carpathia
On the invitation of the Hamazkayin Paris chapter, on November 5, 2018, historian Claude Mutafian presented his book, La saga des Arméniens de l'Ararat aux Carpates (Paris, Belles Lettres, 2018; 448 pages). The event took place at the Demirian Hall of the House of Armenian Culture.
Hera Tosounian opened the event, noting that the subject of the book, the story of Armenians who moved to Carphathia from the Ararat plain, has received little attention before now from historians. The speaker knew about the migration of Armenians to eastern Europe only from Simon Vratsian’s multivolume Kyanki Ughinerov. Starting in the mid-eleventh century, many Armenians had relocated from the Caucasus to that region.
Professor Mutafian spoke for an hour and half, offering vignettes about Armenians in Carpathian Europe: When and why did Armenian communities get established in the region? What paths did they take there? What kind of relations did they have with other minorities? What did they contribute to local culture?
Armenian communities were established in Italy, Crimea, and Eastern Europe in the middle ages.
The Carpathian region encompasses present-day Romania, eastern Ukraine (which was part of Poland until 1918), and western Poland.
At the conclusion of the event, copies of the book were sold.
The first printing of the book (a print run of 1,000) has already sold out.
A second printing is anticipated on November 20.

Aleppo-Armenian singer Aram Khachadurian sang “Dun im hayreni.”
Avo Katrjian, a lecturer at the Hamazkayin Armenian Studies Institute in Aleppo, presented the book.
He began his review with a discussion of the author’s activities in Armenia and the diaspora, calling him one of the best examples of a bridge between the two, with his inner passion for national concerns.
“Those who know the author well know that he is a vigorous activist in national life, and the reader of Arevi Bnakavayre will see that the author is equally concerned with the issues of the homeland the diaspora,” said Mr. Katrjian.
He then revealed that Arevi Bnakavayre was published in 2016 in Yerevan by the printer and publisher Tigran Metz.
The book, written in Eastern Armenia, is 335 pages long.
The editor is Arshak Banuchian.
The author has dedicated the book to the eternal memory his daughter Nazeni.
The collection encompasses memories from Yerevan, Armenia, Artsakh, and various diaspora communities.

The title reflects the contents.
Katrjian said the author had an accessible style, full of imagery and a heart beating with the homeland.
“The stories in the collection are taken from real life because they speak to the roots.
In them you find, saved from catastrophe, the surviving Armenians in Aleppo, Damascus, Kessab, and Western Armenia and their oral histories,” he said.
He invited those present to read the book to discover, through the author’s memories and feelings, the people and types living in Armenia and the diaspora.
The book is more than literature; it is an archival document, he said.
Never Nersesian, a student at the institute, read “In Aleppo an Armenian Won’t Get Lost,” an essay from the book.
The violinist Armen Chenterechian, from Armenia, performed “Tsaygerg,” with Ruzan Barsumian accompanying on the pipe organ.

He said the ghost of war always haunts us.

In Greece, Hamazkayin Remembers Children Lost to Genocide
Some initiatives earn especial attention because of the idea behind them, their goal, and the symbolic nature of their implementation.
This initiative had humanitarian purposes; it constituted bearing witness to a historical tragedy; it let memory survive; and it spread messages to civilized society.

In Los Angeles, Hamazkayin Niari Dance Ensemble Holds Annual Performance
Folk dance reflects the quotidian life of a nation. It is history. Tradition. Intimate relations. Temperament. Enduring values. It touches everyone’s heart.
Armenian dance is vivacious, vigorous, gracious, and supple. It is flirtatious and also virile. Armenian dance is an accessible and pleasing way to maintain a national spirit and identity. Teaching the art of dance to new generations is indispensable, encompassing, as it does, Armenian music, song, a rich tradition of costumes, as well as choreography.
Our people have danced to celebrate weddings, military victories, the harvest, and traditional holidays. Our dances have reflected a fighting spirit and a joyful disposition.
In practically all Armenian schools in Southern California the beautiful arts of Armenian dance are taught.
Likewise, cultural organizations (and particularly Hamazkayin) and private individuals teach dance to groups of children, teenagers, and young adults.
The Hamazkayin San Fernando Valley “Baruyr Sevag” Chapter, on October 6, 2018, held the annual performance of its Niari dance ensemble at the CSU Northridge Plaza Del Sol Theatre.
After months of long and exhausting practice, 65 enthusiastic children, teenagers, and young adults took the stage with a program of folk and contemporary dances.

In Southern California, Hamazkayin Holds “We are Eternal Through our Culture” Dinner
September 29, 2019, shall remain an unforgettable memory in the annals of Hamazkayin and a shiny page in the history of the Hamazkayin Western U.S. region.
The evening was unprecedented, first as a prelude to the cultural events planned for the month of October, and second as a gathering to raise support the Western U.S. regional executive board’s growing program, which includes the significant expenses associated with expanding the community center.
Why a folk day?
Inside the folds of ethnographic culture, the birth certificate of the nation lives—the pure culture, uncontaminated by bourgeoisification, our identity card.
Precisely this year, a century and half ago, Gomidas was born and went on to find, through his talent, the source of our culture—in his instance, the musical source—and brought forth our untainted song.
“Horovel” and similar ethnographic songs, Armenian architecture, Karahunch and monuments like it, folk costumes and literary and other values handed down from our forebears are among the countless examples that help us find the roots of our national self-knowledge.
It is appropriate to note that the tables too carried the words of Armenian culture, and especially of those talents whose 150th anniversary are being celebrated.
Armenian carpets, Armenian decorative illustration and handicrafts, village objects, and especially examples of Armenian costumes decorated the stage. For a fleeting moment, they transported the guests to the historic homeland, toward which the sense of longing and connection burns among all, even from thousands of miles away.
The emcee was Vilma Kouyoumjian. She emphasized the indispensable place of art and culture in our lives.
“Culture perfects our way of life,” she asserted, adding, “Hamazkayin’s mission is to preserve and disseminate Armenian culture and it works for the people.
Our nation creates, it invents, it generates its native art, and expresses its identity.”
She skillfully managed the program, reflecting on the rich legacy of Armenian culture, its undeniable role in the survival of the Armenian people, and the role of Hamazkayin members and supporters as its guardians.

At the conclusion of the performances, the chairperson of the chapter executive board, Hamo Yeritsian was invited to speak. He congratulated the instructors and dancers and wished them success. He then invited members of the board and the dance committee to join him on the stage to be thanked.
The chapter was launched six years ago with thirteen members.
The Alik dance ensemble was formed at the same time, with thirteen members, having Sevag Yemenjian as their instructor.
In 2019, the chapter expanded into Stockholm.
In August 2019, the Zartonk dance ensemble was formed for children, with Mariette Massih as instructor.
The two dance ensembles have 53 dancers.
This number reflects a great deal of coordinated effort, which is a source of pride for everyone involved.
Hamazkayin Sweden members are pleased to be part of the larger Hamazkayin family and to contribute to the pages of Hamazkayin’s history.
In Sweden, Hamazkayin Dance Troupes Dedicate Annual Show to 90th Anniversary

In Sydney, Hamazkayin’s Ninetieth Anniversary Celebrated in Style
On October 28, the 90th anniversary of Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society was celebrated at the society’s Arshak and Sophie Galstaun College in Sydney at the initiative of the regional executive board for Australia.
Bishop Haygazoun Najarian, primate of Armenians in Australia and New Zealand, was present, as were leaders of the Armenian Catholic and Armenian Evangelical churches, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation Central Committee, the Armenian Relief Society, Homenetmen, and other organizations active in the region.

Bishop Najarian provided a benediction, after which a sumptuous reception was held.

In Syria, Hamazkayin 90th Anniversary is a Bridge between Tradition and Modernity
According to the Armenian Prelate of Syria, the audience at the December 9, 2018, celebration of the 90th anniversary of Hamazkayin at the Kevork Yesayian Hall in Aleppo expected a traditional Armenian cultural event. The young people on the organizing committee established by the Regional Executive Board, however, gave the audience a welcome surprise.
To have and to keep the traditions, to have that entire legacy, and to bring it to the stage in a contemporary form: that was the concept behind the event.
They brought the shining figures of Armenian culture to the stage. They brought them back to life with their concerns about present-day developments. They allowed the audience to enjoy the historic and contemporary role of Hamazkayin in an appealing artistic and theatrical presentation.
The artistic vision came from Hushig Ghazarian, Shant Urishian, and Kevork Aroyian. There were no speeches and no sermons.
In Syria, Hamazkayin Celebrates Holy Translators

A brief cultural program followed. A group of students in the 4th and 8th grades, full of enthusiasm, recited poems inspired by the inventor of the alphabet, Mesrop Mashtots, and sang two choral pieces. The attendees were overjoyed.
A keynote was delivered by Very Rev. Fr. Zareh Sarkissian, director of Christian Education and Sunday Schools for the Great House of Cilicia.
The priest retold, in some detail, the story of the invention of the Armenian alphabet and the value of remembering the early church fathers who translated the Bible into Armenian. He encouraged the students to know the talented and great writers of the Armenian world, to be inspired by them, and always to keep aloft the mother tongue.
The very reverend father wrapped up the program with a prayer. A reception followed.

In Syria, Shushi Junior Dance Ensemble Performs
Armenians in Aleppo enjoyed three performances by the Hamazkayin Nigol Aghpalian Chapter’s Shushi Junior Dance Ensemble under the artistic direction of Vrej Terzian.
More than sixty children and young adults performed Armenian, Arab, and western dances.
With their colorful costumes and energetic and lithe movements they took the assembled guests on a 90-minute journey from country to country, introducing them to the dances of various cultural traditions.
The event began with the national anthems of Syria and Armenia.
Maral Ghazarian said, speaking in Arabic, that dance is an uninhibited form of expression; when you dance, you can express your innermost feelings.
How arid our daily life must be if dance is not part of it, she said, likening the stage to a garden in spring, where we will see buds, butterflies, and colorful flowers.
Sarin Boghosian, speaking in Armenian, said that dance is an art form that reveals a nation’s particular nature, psychic world, degree of civilization, and relationship to nature and life.
She said Armenians have relied on art, and especially dance, to maintain their character.
When the curtains rose, the impressive arrangement, symbolic of the Shushi ensemble, caught everyone’s eye.
Emcee Maria Aghbabian invited the ensemble to the stage after a few remarks about the value and particularities of Armenian dance.

Nare Mikayelyan, one of the former directors of the Hamazkayin Yerevan office, was the presenter. Speaking briefly about the situation in Armenia after regaining independence in 1991, she then touched on a few styles of poetry. She spoke about Hovhannes Grigoryan, Husik Ara, Hasmik Simonyan, Karen Antashyan, Karine Ashughyan, and others.
Harut Donoyan and Armineh Torikian contributed impressive readings of poetry.
At the conclusion, Tamar Donabedian Kuzuian presented a collection of Bedros Tourian’s works to Ms. Mikayelyan as a token of appreciation for her beneficial presentation.
In Toronto, Teachers in Armenian Literature are Celebrated
When we page through Armenian literature, we meet writers who also played a decisive role as teachers of Armenian language and mores.
On March 24, 2019, the Hamazkayin Toronto “Klatsor” Chapter’s Literary Committee began the eighth year of monthly gatherings. The month’s focus was eight special authors, each a world in himself or herself.
Let us start with the 1800s.
Tlgadintsi (Hovhannes Harutiunian, 1860–1915) is a name familiar only to those who delve deeply into Armenian literature.
His face shows up among the portraits of literary figures lost in the Catastrophe.
Armineh Torikian, in just a few minutes, summed up his contributions, from his birthplace, the village of Tlgatin (Kharpert region), to his martyrdom in 1915.
He was a pedagogue, teacher, principal, author of many stories, novels, and plays that take place in the villages far from the bustling metropolis of Constantinople. They portray the suffering of Armenian villagers in the era before the genocide.
He ran the St. Hagop parish school for many years. In 1887 he founded the central national (nonmissionary) school in Kharpert, which he ran until his death.
His family was also martyred in the genocide.
His works include “Klukhd chur tir,” “Aykiis pshenin,” “Gdage,” “Kavat me miayn,” “Jnjghugneru tadasdane,” “Im pakhds,” and “Akh Asdvadz, Asdvadz.” He also wrote the plays Vor megun yedeven? and Enti temen.
Tlgadintsi’s students included the future writer Rupen Zartarian, another martyr in the genocide.
Armineh read one of Tlgadintsi’s works that well represented his style.
We heard about another member of Tlgadintsi’s generation, Sibil (1863–1934), from Arda Der Hagopian.
Born Zabel Asadour in the Üsküdar district of Constantinople, she was a writer of prose and poetry, a teacher, and a public figure.
She taught in the provinces, then in Constantinople.
She was cofounder of Azkanver Hayuhiats Engerutiun, a women’s group that set out to open schools for girls in Constantinope and especially in the provinces.
She was instrumental in securing greater participation of women in public life and in protecting orphans and the needy.
She was fluent in French as well as Armenian.
The literary critic Hagop Oshagan wrote of her literary legacy: “Sibil’s poetry is a surprising mixture of flawless form, silken turns of phrase, apricot and foamy lacework, golden daggers, soaring scents, and eyecatching colors.”
Arda gave an impressive reading of one of her poems, “Menasdanin guyse” (The girl in the convent), where Sibil’s pure, colorful and delicately woven language is clearly displayed.
The novel Aghchgan me sirde (A girl’s heart) is considered her most important work. Her collection of poems Tsolker brought her wider recognition.
The widely used collection of textbooks, “Tankaran” (Museum) was the result of her joint efforts with her husband Hrant Asadour.
The future writer and public figure Hayganush Mark was among her students.
In a change of pace, Nora Boghosian of the Armenian Relief Society Day School sang “Sireli usutsich” (Beloved teacher) accompanied on piano by soprano, pianist, and vocal coach Sona Hovsepyan.
“In death, even the most famous person leaves behind just a name, two meager words.
It’s the person’s work that stands as his or her legacy that may survive the centuries.”
The name, two meager words, is Levon Shant. His legacy in letters, politics, and education are immeasurable.
Born Levon Seghbosian in 1869 in Constantinople, he lost both parents at a tender age. He attended the Gevorgian Seminary in Ejmiadzin with Gomidas, studied in Europe, and taught in Constantinople, Tbilisi, Marseille, Cairo, and Beirut.
An author of textbooks, a pedagogue, teacher, principal, deputy speaker of the parliament of the Republic of Armenia, a founder of the Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society, Shant was the main founder and for two decades principal of the Hamazkayin Djemaran in Beirut, where he also taught pedagogy and psychology.
Let us take a breath and try to understand what kind of legacy we are discussing.
I am impressed by his intellect, his enthusiasm for the future, his views on life, his beliefs about human beings, his unshakeable will when it came to education.
As for literature, his biggest contributions, according to Oshagan, are in theater. His plays include Shghtayvatze (The chained) and Hin Astvatzner (Old gods). This is true “even though his work is prolific enough to make a Mekhitarist monk envious,” Oshagan wrote.
He avoided the events of his day, including the Catastrophe. His justification is his pursuit of a better humanity.
We hear his poem, “Yes patranke siretsi” (I loved the illusion), read by Aris Chulian, a graduating senior at the Armenian Relief Society Lapoyan high school
How about the literary critic we have now cited twice? Hagop Oshagan (1883–1948) is well known as the greatest critical reader of Armenian literature. His eminence makes his work hard to grapple with. How would he critique our writing about his writing?
The presenter was Daron Halajian; he had worked with Aren Mnatzakanian to prepare his talk.
One of Oshagan’s students, Moushegh Ishkhan, in his book, Im Usutsichnere (My teachers), tells this story: One of Ishkhan’s classmates is secretly solving math problems while Oshagan is analyzing one of Vahan Tekeyan’s works.
“Out! Quickly get out of my classroom!
I stand here and analyze Tekeyan and speak of the values of Armenian language and poetry and you sit there wasting your time on trivialities! Let all the knowledge in the world go to hell.
This is Armenian literature, Armenian spirit, Armenian breath, and the speaker is Oshagan. You must listen.”
Hagop Oshagan (Kufejian) was born in Bursa in northwestern Asia Minor.
He began his studies at the Armash monastery school but stopped because of poverty.
He became literate through self teaching and went on to serve as a critic, teacher, writer, and editor.
He taught at the Melkonian school in Cyprus and the Jarankavorats monstery in Jerusalem.
He published novels, Dzag-Bduge, Haji Abdullah, Mnatsortatse, and others.
He edited, in ten volumes, Hamapatker Arevmdahay Kraganutian (Panorama of Western Armenian literature).
He wrote innumerable analytical pieces.
He died in Aleppo, where he had been invited (from Jerusalem) to mark an anniversary.
He is known for his sparse style.
Ishkhan wrote, “He liked and approved of everything that came from the soul, that was written in blood, that was ‘true’ and bubbling with life.
He fought a war against words strung together without content.”
His heroes were often humble villagers.
Daron read a part of Oshagan’s work, Khonarhnere (The humble ones).
Moushegh Ishkhan studied under Levon Shant and later became Shant’s colleague. Generations of Djemaran students had Ishkhan as their Armenian teacher. His literary legacy includes plays, poems, stories, and novels. His textbook series, Arti hay kraganutyun (Modern Armenian literature), are widely used.
Varak Babian summarized Ishkhan’s lie and literary characteristics.
Moushegh Jenderejian was born in 1914 in Sivrihisar. His year of birth was clarified three decades later when he was reunited with his mother, from whom he had been separated on the road to exile.
He wrote, “I spent the last best years of childhood in Damascus.
I received a diploma from the Armenian national school. After an unsuccessful attempt to learn an artisan skill, I managed to get myself into the Melkonian school in Cyprus for two academic years, studying under Hagop Oshagan.”
Oshagan had a great influence on Ishkhan. Varak read an excerpt from Ishkhan’s Im usutsichnere.
Ishkhan studied pedagogy in Belgium and, until his death in 1990, remained in his position as a teacher at the Djemaran.
His major works are Mnas parov, mangutiun (Farewell, childhood), Hatsi yev luysi hamar (For bread and light), Hatsi yev siro hamar (For bread and love), Sarnaranen yeladz marte (The man who came out of the freezer), Duneru yerke (The song of homes), Vosgi ashun (Golden autumn), Darabank (Suffering), and Im usutsichnere.
He also served as an editor of Aztag daily.
Varag fondly recalls that by the desk of his late father, Kalusd Babian, hung Ishkhan’s translation of Rudyard Kipling’s “If.” Varak read the translation for the audience.
Next up was Boghos Snabian. His roots in Musa Ler, he was nourished with the spirit of a freedom-loving Armenian, and strengthened with Mashtots’s magic; he made Armenia, Armenians, and the Armenian language his vocation, carrying on the legacy of Hagop Oshagan. He brings to bear more than six decades of experience in literature, literary criticism, editing, and education.
I have had the privilege of his company in the past, in the editorial offices of Aztag in Beirut, behind the papers and manuscripts; at his home, filled with countless books.
As a teacher, he has served in national schools, while also publishing literary and critical works.
For 42 uninterrupted years, he has served as editor of the literary journal Pakine.
He served as editor of Aztag and lecturer on Armenian literature at the Hamazkayin Higher Institute for Armenian Studies for twenty years. The author of more than 30 monographs, he had collected and edited over 80 volumes of works by great Armenian writers, including his mentor Oshagan.
In short, a life lived in Armenian literature.
Harutiun Berberian, a student who went on to become a colleague, wrote, “As a teacher, Boghos Snabian was able to convey his endless love, his passion for Armenian literature and the Armenian language to us. That was his greatest merit.”
“The cradle of Western Armenian literature, Constantinople, never dried out,” writes editor and intellectual Nazareth Berberian, referring to poet Zareh Khrakhuni.
Rupen Janbazian prepared a presentation that is read in his absence by Aren Mnatzakanian.
Khrakhuni wrote, “My biography is very simple. It can be summarized in one sentence.
If we set aside the unimportant details, if we neglect the fact, say, that I was born in Yeşilköy on October 16, 1926, was baptized with the Holy Chrism in the local Saint Stepanos church font, started my studies in my village’s Kapamajian school and continued them in the Vienna Mekhitarist fathers’ Pangaltı Lycee, graduating with honors in 1945, studied law for a year and moved to the philosophy, psychology, and sociology department of the Literature Faculty, where I completed the course of studies in four years, went to Paris for the first time in 1951 to delve a bit deeper into the bottomless pit of the history of art and culture without drowning, of course... five years of teaching at the Esayan Lycee, and two more at the Kedronagan, succeeding in bringing forward young poets and writers rather than future megadonors….” Khrakhuni has published more than 25 volumes. He has been an active editor and translator.
In the words of the Rober Haddejian, editor of the Istanbul newspaper Marmara, “He too was a true student of Mesrob Mashtots and paid his debt to his teacher by creating Mesrobadon.”

In Valence, a Fairy Tale Comes to Life
As part of the program, “Books Are Our Friends, Fables Are Our Imagination,” the Hamazkayin L. Shant Chapter of Valence, France, on October 30, 2018, staged Derenik Demirchian’s Puy-Puy Mknike folk tale as a play. The event took place at the Maison de la Culture Armenienne.
The program began with a reading, by Maral Harboyan and Peggy Ekmanian, of the folk tale—in which a mouse makes its way into a coconut, eats its fill, and having put on some weight, cannot get out until it sheds those grams. With the help of props and gestures, they brought the tale to life for the children. Their goal was to encourage reading in the new generation.
The children followed happily and seriously and answered the teachers’ questions.
They were even happier when face paint transformed each child into the titular mouse.
The children got to hear the mouse play the guitar and tasted some coconut as well.
After that, an animated film of the story was shown.
The children joined in song and dance and games.
The children were given a picture of the mouse and the words of a song as souvenirs.
The program ended with a reception.

Hagop Der Melkonian Theater was packed out with directors, actors and theater lovers. Board member of Kasbar Ipegian Theater Group Maral Mkhseyan delivered the opening speech.
She said that it was probably for the first time that they celebrated the International Day of Theater in the Armenian Community of Lebanon, and the celebration was not purposeless.
"The theater, especially the Armenian Theater in Lebanon is facing serious difficulties. Besides expressing appreciation and gratitude, we should discuss the existing problems and reach some conclusions," said M. Mkhseyan.
She also expressed her gratitude to all those who supported the organization of the event.
Khachik Dedeyan corrected the speaker saying that the theater lover society had always come together on each International Day of Theater to pay tribute and bow before all those who contributed to our culture and art, and particularly to theater in the past as well as at present. ″The Armenian culture survived and prospered due to their dedication. We feel proud for the 2,000 -year-old history of the Armenian theater, which survived in harsh conditions and due to faith and many sacrifices.
The theater is a school, which fortifies, educates, makes you honest, and instills taste.
Theater is a result of collective work, efforts and dedication.
It is not a purposeless art but an impetus inspiring the people", stated Dedeyan. Then he spoke about the importance of recovering faith toward the theater, which serves the Armenian people and culture.

CENTRAL EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THE HAMAZKAYIN EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL SOCIETY
Interview with the Hamazkayin Central Executive Board Chairman Dr. Meguerditch Meguerditchian
Many recent initiatives of the Hamazkayin Central Executive Board having educational nature and mainly aimed at preparing new Armenian generation and human resources capable to work for Armenian institutions, obviously aroused interest in the Armenian reality.
For detailed information about it, the "Azdak" Daily initiated an interview with the Central Executive Board Chairman Dr. Meguerditch Meguerditchian, who said that that the Hamazkayin Society has always followed its mission of education making consistent efforts in that direction, organizing new initiatives and working with target generations.
The interview also touched upon the issues concerning the "Pakin" Magazine, International Conference "Issues of Modern Armenian", "Lala and Ara" Application and other initiatives.
Interview
Question – How did you come up with this idea?
What enticed you to take this step?
Arin Kalousdian – Children master new tools of technology and communication as well as adults.
Although scholars believe using these tools can lead to addictive behavior in them, these same tools can serve to entice interest in children, to acquire new knowledge.
In the Armenian diaspora, the majority of kids attend non-Armenian schools, and their time on the computer is spent playing non-Armenian games, which promote the loss of using Armenian in everyday life.
It then becomes imperative to incorporate Armenian in children’s daily activities and games.
With this in mind, Hamazkayin initiated the programming of an app.
A committee was formed comprising of the following members: Arin Kalousdian the project manager, Talin Yahneian the educational consultant, Nayiri Alexandrian the graphics designer, Serouj Baghdassarian the programmer, and Hera Najarian the elocution specialist.
For the funding of the project, the committee produced a video clip, with Hrayr Kalemkerian in charge of the shoot.
Music for the games was provided by Gary Kaner-Harboyan, Megheti Der Haroutounian and George Demirdjian.
I would like to mention that this was the first collaborative project for this group.
Question – What does this game aim to achieve and why World of Colors?
Arin Kalousdian - The purpose of the game was to introduce a game in Armenian on the iOS and Android platforms for children ages 3 and up. They will be able to learn Eastern and Western Armenian through the games, in the classical Armenian orthography.
Talin Yahneian – Learning about colors is an important achievement in the development of.
An 18- month-old child knows how to differentiate between different hues.
At the of age 3 or 4, a child should learn the names of colors in his or her first language, Armenian.
At three years of age, the child will be introduced to the primary colors, and starting at age 4, he or she will be introduced to secondary colors, such as purple.
These games promote the child’s memory, logic, thinking, perception, speaking, attention span, imagination and more.
The games will instill in the child a love for their mother tongue and a curiosity to learn more.
The child will be able to watch, listen, think and develop their skills.
Question – How does this game differ from other games available on the market?
Nayiri Alexandrian – To emphasize the use of Armenian in the game, we decided to create two Armenian characters, Lala and Ara.
The names were chosen keeping in mind their consistent articulations in both Eastern and Western Armenian, their contemporaneity and musicality.
The characters are 4-5 years old, very curious, playfully mischievous, frolicsome and even at times unkempt.
They befriend the players and explore with them the world of colors, all the while helping and guiding them.
Talin Yahneian – While preparing the game, we also consulted chidren.
They chose the characters, brought them to life with their voices and even played with the game through the developmental phases, in order to give us their honest input.
Serouj Baghdasarian - The child chooses from 10 available colors, and for each color gets 4 games, which means he or she can play with a total of 40 games.
Question - How is the child going to learn how to play?
Are there special instructions?
Hera Najarian - Lala and Ara will explain the step of the game.
When the children get a right or wrong answer, Lala and Ara will provide an appropriate response, either praising or encouraging them to try again.
At first we thought it would be go faster and clearer to voice these responses in adult tones; however, in the end we realized the child would appreciate them if they came from a peer.
This was a great challenge that slowed down the process, because it was hard to find children with the right qualifications.
Question – Can you describe the process of selection of the the games, and do you believe that children with different levels of capabilities will be able to navigate through the language barriers and complete the games?
Talin - The games are very diverse.
Through trial and error, the child will be able to complete each game successfully, while following the special instructions and guidelines.
For certain colors, such as red, the games are easier. But even there the child confronts a broad spectrum of new vocabulary to learn, and I am convinced that when knowledge is taught through play, a child learns faster.
Question – How were you able to fund this project?
Arin - We started an online fundraising initiative on Kickstarter, through which we achieved our goal. We then decided to offer the game for free for the first 6 months.
Question – How can parents obtain the the game?
Serouj ­- It’s easy to download it on the iOS and Android platforms, through the Apple Store or Google Play. We will soon update the game, adding the Eastern Armenian option.
Question - How will you promote the game to ensure its circulation so that Armenian kids can get to know and profit from this initiative?
Arin - In order to present and promote the game, we have a special Facebook page called Lala and Ara that already has close to 2000 followers.
We have also launched the website www.lalanouaran.com, where people can become familiar and follow this project.
We will notify further developments of the project through press releases, to promote the game further.
We also believe, through word of mouth, Armenian children will do their share in propagating the game.
If kids like and play with great enthusiasm, I think we can say we’ve reached our goal.

“Pakin” Literary Magazine held an event to introduce the art of filmmaker Artavazd Peleshyan on Wednesday, October 10, 2011, at 7:00 PM, at the editorial offices of “Pakin.”

Mr. Der Ghougassian stressed the fact that the period at the factory has been a very important stage in Peleshyan’s life, as it influenced his filmmaking.
Mr. Der Ghougassian also said that Peleshyan’s pictures are gloomy, and often employ black and white footage. He typically has made shorts, all of them without any conversation or narrative, and tell their story with music.
Hagop Der Ghougassian also noted that in his films Peleshyan uses archival footage and merges them with his own original scenes.
He has always preferred to feature nature, rather than humanity.
On an international level, Peleshyan has created a very unique school of filmmaking and one that is unparalleled.
His oeuvre makes up a unique school of documentary films.
Toward the end of the event, a selection of short films by Peleshyan, such as “We,” “Our century,” and “The seasons,” was presented.

Acknowledging Zohrab’s literary merit, the keynote speaker said: “It is impossible to honor a prince in any other way. A prince who during all the stages of his life and in all circumstances lived in a princely manner, was a nobleman in his society, a knight for his loves, just as in the Assemblies and remained truly a prince not only in his novellas, but also throughout his life.”
Then, outlining Zohrab’s biography, he noted that Zohrab took his firth steps into literature with poetry where genuine emotions were abundant and emphasized that Zohrab was a true poet not only in his poetry, but also in his other literary works, where sentimental portrayals and poetic imagery prevailed.
His literature was diverse: he tried his hand in every literary genre, and, similar to other Realist writers of his generation, was dedicated to writing and to the task of developing the people’s intellect. It is due to this that he was the most talented and unique among the writers of his generation, thus surpassing other contemporaries and even his own teachers.
According to the lecturer, Zohrab was a great intellectual gifted with many skills and the nature of an artist. He loved the good and beautiful, and embodied the climax of the realists by featuring life as it was.
With his holistic lecture loaded with content, Hagop Cholakian once again enchanted the audience and evoked Krikor Zohrab the man, the writer, and the public activist from his birth to his horrible martyrdom.
At the end of the event, Very Reverend Father Vahan Berberian congratulated the event organizers, as well as the lecturer on an exceptional evening.
He concluded the event with a prayer.
Indeed, during that evening the “Prince of Novellas” becamethe sovereign of the audience’s hearts and minds.

Karnig Panian Memoir of Aintoura Orphanage Launched in Paris
The Paris chapter of Hamazkayin organized the launch of Mémoires d'un orphelin arménien: 1914–1920 (Memoirs of an Armenian orphan), the French translation of a book by Karnig Panian, at the House of Armenian Culture on October 15, 2018.
The evening was opened by Nonig Hovhannessian.
She presented the translators, Chant Marjanian and Jean-Michel Bilemdjian. She also noted that a few weeks ago, the Aras publishing house released a Turkish translation of the book in Istanbul.
The book is a memoir about Panian’s childhood. It opens with warm family memories from an Armenian village.
Those happy times were followed by hellish days, in the orphanage at Aintoura, in Lebanon, where 1,200 Armenian orphans lived desolate days in exile.
In that orphanage, the children were raised on spankings and deprivation to further Djemal Pasha’s agenda of Turkification.
Speaking in Armenian, journalist Chant Marjanian explained the work’s importance as testimony and read excerpts.
Jean-Michel Bilemdjian, the co-translator, spoke last.
He recalled the memories of his father Hovhannes.
His father had walked the same path as Karnig Panian in the Aintura orphanage.
The evening ended with an open discussion.
Karnig Panian’s ″Goodbye Antoura″ Launched in English (Canada)
The presentation of Karnig Panian’s (1910-1989) book ″Goodbye Antoura″ took place on Sunday, 2 October 2016. The original book is Panian's ‘‘Childhood and Orphanage Memories''.
The Hamazkayin ″Kladzor″ Chapter's Book Distributor Committee had invited Karnig Panian's daughter Houri Panian Boyamian from Boston to take part in the event.
Houri Panian and her sister Shaghik were the initiators of the translation and publication of the book at the reputable Stanford University Press Publishing House.
The host of the event was ARS Daily School Deputy Principal and Head of ″Sara Corning Genocide Studies″, Raffi Sarkissian.
In his preface, Raffi Sarkissian talked about the difficult responsibility assumed by the orphaned generation to survive, preserve the native language and culture, and to create a stable basis for establishing diaspora.
Due to such efforts, the Armenian identity, cause, and claims are never forgotten. They have even become more powerful.
Raffi Sarkissian noted in his speech the importance of such memoirs, because our history and collective experience are based on personal individual experiences of survivors, which convey the true face of the genocide, its effects, pains, and losses.
Then, Raffi Sarkissian presented Karnig Panian’s brief biography.
Panian was born in Dzakh Dzor Village of Koryun district in Sebastia. He was five when his family was subject to exodus, and the boy orphaned on the desert road.
Djemal Pasha organized the relocation of hundreds of thousands of Armenian orphans to Antoura where they were subject to the terrible danger of Turkification. The little boy was one of them.
When he finally left that hell, he appeared in the Armenian orphanage of Jbeil.
There he learned the craft, and then entered Djemaran. In 1935, he was one of the first alumni of Djemaran.
Panian worked as a mentor, wrote books, and became the vice-director of Hamazkayin Nshan Palandjian Djemaran.
He was a founding member of the Alumni Association and editor of Agos Official.
Panian was also an active member of Hamazkayin and Chair of National Authority.
He made a great contribution to the activities of National Parliamentarians.
In other words, he was a person worthy of his nation.
His student Vazgen Terzian recounted episodes from school years and spoke about the role of Djemaran in the formation of national consciousness.
Levon Tanayan participated in the event playing two songs on the piano.
Two students from ARS Daily School read excerpts from the book.
Mher Grachian read an extract about Panian's birthplace, where he spent the first five years of his family life in a warm and comfortable atmosphere. The author amazingly remembered all the details of their life, the scent, care and nature of his childhood.
Araz Fr. Ohan read another part from the book, the contents of which was quite different from the previous ones. Here the hunger made Armenian orphans eat insects and drink ink, which brought to lethal "falakhas" and caused inhuman attitude towards them.
Sarkissian invited Houri Panian Boyamian to speak. Houri Panian is the principal of St. Stepanos School at Watertown. She has been working there since 1988.
Houri Panian was awarded the Mesrop Mashtots Medal by Aram I Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia and the Queen Zabel Medal by the US Eastern National Prelacy.
Wishing to contribute to education in the best way, she returned to University and received her Master's degree in education.
Due to her efforts, St. Stepanos School has become the first Armenian highly qualified school among the independent schools of New England.
In other words, she serves the education in the best way and with great dedication like his father.
In her speech, Houri Panian Boyamian explained the three main reasons, which made her initiate the translation of the book into English.
First, very few people know about the Turkification of Armenian children. The translated book will be helpful for wider Armenian and foreign readers, historians and especially for specialists making researches on Armenian Genocide.
Second, the book will contribute to the Armenian Cause and Armenian claims, and the third, to commemorate the Armenian orphans on the Centennial of the Armenian Genocide, their struggle and sacrifice for the preservation of their identity and roots and for establishing a huge diaspora.
During the evening, very important and historical photos were displayed on the screen, such as Djemal Pasha’s visit to orphanage, the first graduates, and teachers of Djemaran, the meeting of National Council in Jerusalem with two Catholicoses, the newly built cross-stone monument for unburried orphans of Antoura etc.
Toward the end of the event, the organizing committee chair Garo Akinian presented the book ″From the Red Desert to Jerusalem″ to Houri Panian Boyamian as a souvenir.
The former students of Djemaran, the genocide survivors’ children and grandchildren surrounded the guest.
The Committee served coffee, cookies, and fruits to 100 guests.
Translator Simon Beojekian's meticulous work is worth appreciation.
The book is available in English and Armenian at Hamazkayin "Y. Manoogian" Library.

Kasbar Ipegian Theater Group of Hamazkayin performs “Parki vashkharounere” (“The merchants of glory”) (Lebanon)
The Kasbar Ipegian Theater Group of Hamazkayin started its performances of the play “Parki vashkharounere” (“The merchants of glory,” by Marcel Pagnol) on Friday, March 23, 2012, at the Hagop Der Melkonian Theater. The performances were staged by Robert Arakelyan.
Although this play by Pagnol was written more than half a century ago, its topic is very much current.
Years have passed, yet there are merchants of glory who are ready to sacrifice anything, even their dignity, for the sake of personal benefits and higher status. However, they do so for the sake of the fatherland, freedom, or for that moment’s fashionable cause.
The Kasbar Ipegian Theater Group actors were wonderful in bringing to life the characters, giving genuine expression to the play and the message of the playwright.
With this performance, Kasbar Ipegian Theater Groups adds another excellent chapter to its activities of more than 70 years.
This only proves that Hamazkayin remains true to its mission of preserving and spreading Armenian culture.
New or veteran actors have roles in this play: Kevork Nalbandian in the role of Bashil, Tina Tashjian, as Bashil’s wife, Nareg Arakelian, as Max Bashil, Haverj Shekherdemian in the role of Anna, Palig Ladoyian in the role of Rita, Hovhannes Helvajian in the role of Grand, Hrag Demirjian in the role of Berlo, Vartan Aznavorian in the role of Rishab, Jean Bekerejian in the role of the count, and Boghos Malian in the role of the officer.
Kasbar Ipegian Theater Group of Hamazkayin presents the play “Zanzalakhd” (Lebanon)
For the past 70 years the Kasbar Ipegian Theater Group of Hamazkayin has presented various theatrical productions, actors, and stage directors and has always succeeded in satisfying audiences.
In May 2012 the theater group took the stage to present “Zanzalakht,” a play by Lebanese playwright Issam Mahfouz. The performance was directed by Hagop Der Ghougassian and its fresh breath and unique stage setting were remarkable.
The stage space and lighting gave the actors freedom to move around and give their best performances.
The costumes gave the true picture of each actor.
The actors were very knowledgeable of the context and its depth.
With this performance the Kasbar Ipegian Theater Group of Hamazkayin proved it persists as the true successor of Georges Sarkissian, Kasbar Ipegian, and many other talented actors.
The theater group also came to verify that Lebanese-Armenian theater will soon play an important role and knows how to present high art performances.
The mingling of five experienced actors with several new ones deserves a special note, as this features a true and promising view of the rejuvenation of stage actors.
With this performance stage director Hagop Der Ghougassian succeeded to convey messages of the bare truth through laughter, things that the audience will be able to perceive only during the performance and will leave the hall with mixed feelings and thoughts.
This performance is also proof to the Lebanese audience that Lebanese-Armenian theater continues to maintain a high quality.
The Arabic text of the performance was presented on the screen for the Lebanese Arab audience.
Zaven Baaklini, Hovsep Kaplanian, Garo Kjelian, Jano Bekerejian, Hrag Papazian, Hrag Demirjian, Vartan Aznavourian, Vazken Tarpinian, Hagop Zadirian, and Njteh Mgrdichian all performed in “Zanzalakht.”
Kaspar Ipekian Theater’s New Performance Leon (Lebanon)
The young artists of Kaspar Ipekian Theater and director Hrayr Kalemkerian staged a half-hour performance. The psychological distress manifested in the performance in various ways, evoked laughter, and puzzled the audience.
In the first act, when the first two experimentators (Vardan Mgrdichian and Serouj Hovsepyan) try to enter into Leo’s (Shahen Arapoghlian) brain and extract very different characters hidden there, the stage turns into Leon’s inner world.
In the simple decoration of the stage, there is a deck, where the characters appear from time to time. With each character’s entrance, Leon appears in a completely different psychological state. Though all happens in a comic form, in reality it is very profound.
Preoccupied with this experiment, Leon turns into a teacher and goes to Kiulienchikov village, where the inhabitants have been cursed for more than two hundred years, and they suffer from being foolish.
Leon has one mission in this village. It is to educate the village doctor's daughter, Sofia. If he succeeds in this mission, the villagers will be safe from being foolish.
Keghart Dancers Perform in Latakia
Under the auspices of His Grace Archbishop Shahan Sarkisian, Armenian Prelate of Syria, the Hamazkayin Latakia Vahan Navasartian Chapter Executive Board organized a performance of the Keghart Dance Ensemble for an audience of over 500 Armenians and Arabs. The program featured Armenian and non-Armenian dances.
Artistic director and dance teacher Suren Kirazian worked with small children, teenagers, and young adults for four months before the first public engagement of the ensemble. Mr. Kirazian worked to highlight each dancer’s special abilities and talent.
The ensemble performed at the Al-Assad Cultural Center in Latakia. The parish priest, Rev. Vazken Keoshgerian, the parish council, representatives of organizations, government officials, scout leaders, troops, and hundreds of other audience members.
Opening in Armenian, Vartuhi Garabedian-Tulumjian asked the audience to stand for a moment of silence to honor the memory of martyrs in Syria, Armenia, and Artsakh.
She then reflected on the initiative of His Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia, to proclaim 2019 the Year of the Armenian Press. She spoke of the mission of Hamazkayin to inspire young people with Armenian culture and spirit. She said parents had an important obligation to direct their children toward Armenian culture, so the children may always be connected to Armenian life.
Ms. Tulumjian presented the dance ensemble and its artistic director. She thanked the president of Syria, the cultural officials of Damascus, the Hamazkayin Syria Regional Executive, the members of the Keghart Dance Ensemble, and their parents.

Maggie Babikian, chairperson of the organizing committee, opened the event. She read a ode to the Armenian language penned by Mr. Bedigian. This reading left a great impression on the attendees.
She then noted that the month of October is dedicated to Armenian culture and particularly to the Holy Translators; she found this month a propitious time to hold a book event.
Bedigian has, since his student days, been a servant at the pagan altar of Armenian literature, giving the diaspora the gift of fifty years of service.
The longtime educator Arpy Hamparian Jierian took the stage next to present the book. She first presented the book in general, noting the year of publication, the place, and the contents. She also read from the foreword by Shakeh Mangasarian.
Khachaturian’s Kayane Links Generations (Canadian)
At this weekend, there was a wedding in Montreal Armenian community. It was the wedding of Kayane and Armen, which was like a grand performance of Armenian music and dances.
When any performance or music makes you tearful in the dark hall, it means it touches your heart.
Isn’t it the purpose of all kinds of art?
Any kind of art must storm your brain, and fill your heart with noble feelings.
In this sense, the wedding in Ashnanazard Village, which took place on 14 and 15 October 2017, at Pierre Mercure Hall of Montreal, reached its goal deservingly.
Probably the most impressive scene of the wedding was the presence of different generations on the stage.
How awesome it was to see white bearded grandfathers hugging their grandchildren, the grandmothers cherishing their children, and finally the excited and extremely happy youngsters.
Of course, it was the most impressive and touching scene for the audience.
Not only were the representatives of different generations, wearing colorful costumes, attractive. The atmosphere in the backstage, with sweaty dancers, children rushing to change their costumes, with Committee members running here and there, and with those who did different minor jobs, was more amusing.
I am convinced that it was much more pleasant to be in that quirky charming environment than on the stage.
Very Rev. Fr. Vartan Tashjian’s presence on the stage on his true mission was nice and impressive.
On other occasions, Father Vartan had just left an impression of a clergyman fond of Armenian songs and culture.
With this his speech he also proved his closeness to the young generation, which would certainly have very constructive consequences.
The right to evaluate the skills of soloists and all dancers should be given to dance professionals.
However, when more than two hundred and fifty children, and the young and elderly dancers entered the stage to present Aram Khachaturian's Kayane, after having prepared for this performance for months, listening to Khachaturian's classical and folk music․ Now they finally danced Khachaturian, and we believe that the love for art has already been injected to purify the souls, and in future, we can certainly reap the fruits.
The direction of a dance group consisting of two hundred and fifty members needs a talent combined with the dance skills.
In an instant, I witnessed how Mrs. Eva Hayrapetian was performing the last checks in the backstage.
I noticed the way she was looking at the dancers, and it was quite enough to understand that the ensemble had achieved success due to her apparent stability and decisiveness.
Kayane’s first performance took place in Russia in 1942.
Minas Avedisian's stage decorations, created for Kayane ballet in 1974, have always impressed the spectators.
To use his decorations for this performance a special right was needed with a set tariff.
By using these unique stage decorations and the copied duplicate costumes of the National Academic Theater of Opera and Ballet of Yerevan, the Ani dance ensemble of Hamazkayin once again eternalized Khachaturian’s creation.
The duplicitous works directly depend on tariffs and your budget. However, it is appropriate to state here that according to psychologists, the people who share or grant are happier than others.
So happy are Atom and Seda Malkhasian, who are not just ordinary companions, but also honorable defenders of culture.
We are also happy to share our gratitude to all big and small participants.
We hope that after so many years, the old and new performances of Kayane or Gikor will be met again on the stage with the same enthusiasm, exactly as it happened last weekend.
Last weekend there was a wedding.
The gracious girls danced and wove carpets and charmed the hearts.
Again the ground thundered under the boys’ feet, the evil was prevented, and the love, the light of love, the colorful love won...

Khachig Dedeyan’s Poetry in Two Volumes Presented in Lebanon
Under the auspices of the prelate Archbishop Nareg Alemezian, an event was held on February 7, 2019, at the Piunig Hall of the editorial offices of Aztag, celebrating the publication of volumes 1 and 2 of Khachig Dedeyan’s collection of poems, Yerazen antin (Beyond the dream). The event was organized by the Literary Committee of Hamazkayin.
Jacques Hagopian welcomed the audience. He said poetry is a valuable mode of expression and emphasized that it has been important in Armenian literature.
He said one of the goals of the Literary Committee is to stand by those who believe in diaspora Armenian literature, and present their work to the public. The celebration, he said, is in furtherance of this goal.
Dikran Jinbashian spoke on behalf of the committee. He said language and culture are generally among the most essential characteristics of a nation’s identity. For Armenians, deprived on land, national survival depends on a spiritual homeland, and Hamazkayin serves to create and cultivate that spiritual place.
Various aspects of culture have their own bodies in the organization, he said, but not so literature, which is an individual undertaking requiring the right environment, which now no longer exists.
According to Mr. Jinbashian, those who wish to express themselves and commit their internal voice to paper have become rare in the diaspora and, to an extent, in Armenia. It remains for us to take solace in what little is still written, generated, and created.
He said poetry edits and serves as a living witness to feelings, events, and situations. Putting that inspiration down in concise form means rejecting the trivial, the detail, and keeping the pureblooded essential real word. “Khachig Dedeyan is a purveyor of the essential word. The two volumes bring together his three monographs, pieces scattered in the press, and unpublished works for us to appreciate in one place,” he concluded.
Khrimian Hayrik Play Performed in Lebanon
The solo show “Khrimian Hairik” was performed in Beirut on November 14 at the Hovhannes Boghossian Theater House by the New York–based dramatist, director, actor, writer, literary critic, scientist, teacher, and community leader Herand M. Markarian, who wrote the play. The program was sponsored by Hamazkayin’s Lebanon Regional Executive Board.
Speaking on behalf of the board, Houri Zakarian welcomed the audience, saying the theme of this presentation was not arbitrarily selected; it is about a national awakening, which is something Armenia and the Armenian diaspora truly need today.
Khrimian Hayrik Speaks to Armenians in Cyprus
On November 11, Khrimian Hayrik climbed onstage in Nicosia and delivered his powerful message to Armenians, emphasizing our homeland, our faith, our culture, and the importance of the Armenian family for the preservation and perpetuation of the Armenian nation.
The event was sponsored by Hamazkayin’s Cyprus chapter. The audience was spellbound by Khrimian Hayrik’s story, events from his life, his role as a cleric, and the difficulties he faced.
They followed emotionally as they watched his years as Patriarch of Constantinople and then Catholicos of all Armenians, his attendance at the Berlin summit (1878), his resistance to the confiscation of Armenian church properties by the Tsarist government (1903), and other notable events from his life.
The performance concluded with the audience showing their appreciation for the performers with thunderous applause and celebration. They also expressed their sentiments to Dr. Hrant Markarian, who presented the personality of Khrimian Hayrik in a moving and glorious way with an artful monologue that lasted over an hour.
The presentation had an educational aspect, highlighting patriotism and progressivism.
Dramatist, director, actor, writer, literary critic, scientist, teacher, and community leader Hrant Markarian (U.S.A.) wrote the play and starred in it. He brought to life a miraculous representation of Khrimian Hayrik in a way that will be indelible in the minds of Armenians in Cyprus.
The audience left the hall in the hopes of seeing Dr. Markarian and his art again before long; they placed the burden of realizing that hope on Hamazkayin.
Kindergarten Textbook, “I Play, I Learn, I Grow,” Presented in Lebanon
On June 28, at the Hamazkayin Vahe Setian Press, the second kindergarten textbook in the Hamazkayin “I Play, I Learn, I Grow” series was launched.

The group that prepared the second volume, released this year, comprised Talin Yahniyan, Seta Madzunian, Maria Bilemjian, and Araz Tashjian.
The artistice director and illustrator is Nancy Mumchochlian.
All the kindergarten teachers of the Armenian schools in Lebanon were present for the presentation.
Knowledge Competition Held in Thessalonica
The Hamazkayin Thessalonica Alishan Chapter Executive Board on January 25, 2020, held a competition at the Der-Zakarian Hall. The event, that went on late into the night, had 30 young people answering questions.
The spiritual leader of the parish was present.
The participants were divided into two groups.

Kourken and Margaret Asadourian Bequeath One Million Two Hundred Ninety-Nine Thousand and Forty US Dollars to the Hamazkayin Djemaran in Beirut

Kousan Choir Holds Christmas Concert in Lebanon
The Hamazkayin “Kousan” Choir held its first Christmas concert on December 29, 2019, at the Mor Yacoub Church in Byblos, Lebanon. Held under the auspices of His Holiness Aram I, the event was organized by the women’s society of the Bird’s Nest orphanage, Aztag reports. Conducted by Krikor Alozian, with Hasmig Kasbarian accompanying on piano, the choir sang familiar traditional Christmas songs and carols from the Gomidas collections.
They also sang noels in Assyrian, Arabic as spoken in Lebanon, and English.
The traditional Armenian duduk was featured, as was the classical violin, performed by Kousan members Natalie Apokian and Rita Asdigian. The day’s soloists were Shoghig Torosian (soprano) and Avedis Akrabian. Members of the ARF Student Association of Lebanon “Ararat” Core provided interpretations in Arabic.
During the concert, Bishop Michel Aoun, Eparch of the Maronite Catholic Eparchy of Jbeil, the mayor, and two municipal officials spoke.
Bishop Meghrig Parikian, general manager and principal of Bird’s Nest, also spoke and gave Mari Shami an award for many years of service. He praised the Hamazkayin choir, its conductor, and its members.
Kousan Choir Performs in Cambridge, Ontario
We hear here and there about how non-Armenian influences constantly and everywhere threaten the character and identity of Armenian song, and we are alert witnesses to this phenomenon ourselves. These influences include Turkish, Persian, Arabic, and other tunes.
Fortunately, this phenomenon has another side: the hard work of keeping Armenian song untainted and passing it on to the up-and-coming generation. This is the effort to which Hamazkayin is dedicated. In this instance, we are talking about the “Kousan” Choir of the Toronto “Klatzor” Chapter.
On Sunday, March 17, 2019, the “Kousan” Choir held a concert at the Cambridge Armenian Community Centre, on the invitation of the local “Datev” Chapter. It was meticulously coordinated in terms of the variety of songs and the high-quality, moving performances. The performance affected and brought a sense of pride, especially for a small community like that of Cambridge, which has few Armenian events over the course of the year.
We are in the Cambridge Armenian Community Centre hall, the time has come, and to the sound of applause, one by one the sixty singers of “Kousan” come on stage, followed by veteran accompanist Vanik Hovhannisian and talented conductor Hripsime Tovmasian. Not a second later, the voices rise toward the homeland, our place of origin and our place of return.
With “Im heravor hairenik,” we sing our longing for Mounts Ararat and Sipan. With “Karahisar,” our national spirit is raised again. With the soft “Yes aghchig em,” our spirits lighten for a moment. Then we come to “Kele Lao.”
Few today perform our ancestral songs with as much familiarity as folk singer Nver Ghazarian, who was accompanied on the duduk by his son Seyran Ghazarian. Then we heard Silva Kaputikyan’s poem “Kele Lao,” interpreted by Tamar Donabedian Kuzuian.
“Bingeol” and Gomidas’ “Gayni yaro” are performed by the choir. On the wings of “Groong,” captivated by “Nubar’s” height, as described in the song, we come to the second solo: “Badranki tevov,” an ode to mothers, was performed brilliantly by Mineh Satourian.
Composer Parsegh Ganachian’s “Shusho” has a special place for “Kusan” members, with both its use of dialect and its music. Handsome Shusho’s charms and the mountains of Sasun bring us to the familiar and beloved, “Ay vard,” which is interpreted by the talented Levon Karagulleian, a star of the choir.
After Gara Murza’s “Lebho le le,” “Yerevan” closes out the first part of the program, leaving the audience thirsty and impatient for the second part.
In the second part, with “Lur kisherin,” the stars give voice to the moon and a mysterious atmosphere descends on the hall thanks to the lyrics by Avedik Isahakian.
The succession of soft songs continues. Ara Ter Haroutunian and longtime “Kousan” soloist Raffi Ter Boghosian sing “Akh aghchig” as a beautiful duet. Ter Boghosian sings H. Krikorian’s “Tuyl dvek tarnam,” which receives enthusiastic applause.
The choir performs “Ay yar” and then we hear “Hovvi yerke.” Nver Ghazarian is impressive again, accompanied by the choir.
The joyful “Nazan yar” is performed. Then the poem “Hayastan aselis” by Hamo Sahyan is performed, set to music by pianist Vanik Hovhannisian. The song is moving, as is Levon Karagulleian’s interpretation.
Levon continues to impress the audience with his attractive voice as he sings, “Yeregon navahankstum” along with the choir.
The next three songs again point our eyes toward the homeland.
“Parki champov” is followed by “Dun im hayreni.” Mineh Satourian’s voice is heard again, with some contributions by the choir.
The program is closed with a heartrending rendition of the beloved “Yerevan-Erebuni.”
Thanks to the dedication and meticulous persistence of conductor Hripsime Tovmasian and the unstinting, influential contributions of pianist Vanik Hovhannisian, pure Armenian song radiates from the stage.
Gomidas and Ganachian performed, as did Hekimian, Gara Murza, Alemshah, Avetisian, and Altounian.
A total of 23 creations—solos, duets, duduk accompaniment, and poetry—were heard. There were longtime performers and talented young stars; old and new songs; pearls of national, classical, and folk music. It was a high-quality, harmonious, group performance.
Cambridge “Datev” Chapter president Samuel Movsisian thanked the performers and audience and handed an especially prepared floral bouquet.
What the audience took home was a flight of the spirit, a sense of price, a chunk of homeland.

Krikor Agopian Holds Solo Exhibit in Lebanon
On May 9, 2019, a solo exhibit of Krikor Agopian’s work was held at the Hamazkayin Lucy Tutunjian Art Gallery in Beirut. The event was held under the auspices of Archbishop Nareg Alemezian, prelate of the Armenians of Lebanon.
It featured 98 acrylic and mixed media works that are part of the artist’s personal collection.
Gallery director Hagop Havatian said the exhibit was memorable because it covered fifty years of Agopian’s creative life.
“Fifty years of dedication, loyalty, honesty toward his work, ups and down in life, and today he appears with his monumental work, the fruits of a huge number of exhibits. He is constantly innovating and insists on looking ahead.” Mr. Havatian added that he had come to know the artist on the very day the gallery was established, and they have been cooperating for ten years. The artist has had an important role in Lebanese-Armenian fine arts, Mr. Havatian noted.
Mr. Agopian is meticulous and disciplined, he said, and has a bright perspective on life. He faces difficulties with a smile and with a commitment to overcoming them. His art smiles as us and ennobles our spirits while bringing beauty to our environment.

Lebanon Regional Board Issues Communique
The Hamazkayin Regional Executive Board for Lebanon held its 15th plenary session on June 10, 2020, at the Aghpalian-Homenetmen Sports and Culture Complex. The board having met remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this was the first recent in-person meeting.
The board listened to and considered the report of each chapter’s representative. The board found that, in spite of the unprecedented situation, a broad set of online activities had been undertaken in cooperation with the trustees and administrators of the Schools of Fine Arts: the Literary Platform, Kousan choir, Knar dance troupe, Davigh instrumental ensemble, Garod school, and Kasbar Ipeghian theater troupe have been active online.
The board had a positive assessment of the work done so far and especially of the coordinating activities of the media group established for this purpose, and of the growth in Facebook followers. The board decided to encourage the artistic groups and continue to provide high-quality cultural programming online, keeping the community connected to culture and remaining true to its calling as an educational and cultural institution.
Unfortunately, in addition to the pandemic, Lebanon has been dealing with an economic crisis, as a result of which the Regional Executive Board is deeply concerned about whether the activities of the Schools of Fine Arts can be sustained.
Consequently, the board decided to consider the 2019–2020 school year to be over, and will look to reopen in October for the next school year.
Taking into consideration the country’s economic difficulties and keeping in mind that it’s unrealistic to expect help from the relevant circles, the board expects to tighten belts, make cuts where necessary, and begin making new arrangements and contracts.
If things continue as they are, the Regional Executive Board’s only hope are national benefactors, donors who serve the nation and its organizations, whether in Lebanon or abroad, because investing in the arts means investing in the future of Armenian civilization.
Notwithstanding the enormous challenges facing the board and the unpredictability of the future, the members of the board are prepared to continue their mission with the same fervor and optimism as ever.

Lebanon Sees First Puppet Show in Years
On December 14, 2018, in the Hovhannes Boghosian Theater in Lebanon, the Republic of Artsakh Shushi Mgrdich Khantamirian State Theater gave a puppet showing of “Hay Muke” (Armenian mouse). The show’s artistic director was popular artist Leonid Harutyunian.
The show took 45 minutes and was meant for children six and older.
The message of the presentation was that being little is not a bad thing.
If someone wants to fight, live, and has the vital strength to do so, age doesn’t mean anything; what matters is willpower.
The presentation was noteworthy because it had been years since Lebanon had seen a puppet show.
The show caused great joy among the children in the hall, who followed the story closely.

Lecture by Krikor Tersakian Regarding Armenia’s Forests (Canada)
Hamazkayin Cultural and Educational Society organized a gathering under the “Tea, Coffee and thoughts” heading depicting Armenian forestry. The event took place at the Bois de Liesse Park’s “Maison Pitfield” gathering hall, located at the heart of Montreal’s nature scene.
Seventy-five people attended the presentation to hear Krikor Tersakian’s “Armenian Forests and the Armenian Youth” topic. Attendees had already gotten a feel for the topic- they were surrounded by splendid trees and ponds covered in water lilies. They were also served with the tradition coffee and tea, impatiently waiting for the beginning of the presentation.
Mrs. Diroug Manjikian gave the opening remarks and mentioned the concept behind the event, as well as the program.
The main topic of the event was trees, which led the gathering to take place in the park.
In her speech, Mrs. Manjikian stated that this gathering was driven by the serious and imminent deforestation issue occurring in present day Armenia by money-driven companies and individuals and Armenia’s Youth’s vigor, dedication and drive to bring attention to this issue and put an end to it.
She continued by stated that Armenians have always had a special connection and love towards trees.
As customary, the gathering had a cultural portion.
Attendees first got to enjoy Roupen Hakhverdian’s “Pats Ko Gegheve, Dzar”. Melissa Haroutiounian, from the Sourp Hagop church youth choir “Nor Dzaghig” performed the song “ Groung, Kna mer Ashkharhits”.
In between the songs, Mrs. Diroug Manjikian was quoting proverbs, myths and fables about trees and nature.
Mrs. Anahid Balian provided further information regarding Armenia’s ancient High Spirited trees (Sosiants Andar).
Attendees were also introduced to different types of trees from Armenia’s forests, with both their English and Armenian names. This research was done by Mr. Hagop Manjikian.
The cultural program continued by a poem recited by Arpi Soghomonian who performed Missak Medzarents’ “Akassianeroun Shoukin Dag”, followed by Sona Titizian, who ended the programing by reading Moushegh Ishkhan’s “Bardizbane”.
Mrs. Manjikian gave a short biography of the lecturer. Unger Krikor Tersakian was born in Beirut, Lebanon and has attended the Hamazkayin Nshan Palamdjian Djermaran and graduated in 1977.
He has two degrees from the American University of Beirut- Bachelor of science in Agriculture and Agricultural Engineer diploma.
He later moved to Montreal, Canada in 1991, where he attended and graduated Concordia University in History.
He is a member of the Golden Key International Honor Society.
Ung. Terzakian gave a thorough and meticulous presentation, using PowerPoint slides to depict his research about Armenia’s forestry and environment, and share his concerns about the current state of Armenia’s biosphere.
He realistically presented the sad reality of the modern state of the forests, and gave the explanation behind the causes. He emphasized that the reasoning lie in the population that is unaware and ill-informed when it comes to the land’s fauna and flora. Part of the responsibility also lies in the current government’s stance and policy regarding Armenia’s forests and ecology.
He mentioned the great work done by diasporan organizations and individuals who have put in the effort to plant trees, calling this an important and fundamental work that needs to continue. 
Attendees were very pleased with the lecture and presentation. The topic was novice for most, and highly educational. The lecture was followed by a Q & A period, which led the discussion of the topic to continue.
Before the conclusion of the event, Melissa once again performed Inga and Anush’s “Menk Enk Mer Sarere” song, much to everyone’s pleasure.
As customary for these events, there was a lottery at the end, and four lucky participants each won a plant emblemizing the day’s topic.
Guests returned home with hope of a better future to come for Armenia’s ecology and reforestation program.

The key lecturer Shahan Kandaharian divided the material into three main parts:
After making reports on three directions, Shahan Kandaharian concluded: “Today Cyprus is the most positive place in the world for Armenian processes.
Therefore, the more vivid the relations with Yerevan are, the more Cyprus appears in the center of the Diaspora organizations’ political activities, and the more accurately the Armenian Media illustrates such statements and political steps, the more profitable it will be for the entire Armenian field, - State, Diaspora, and Media."

Lecture on youth in Armenia and contemporary Armenian literature (Lebanon)
The Regional Committee of Hamazkayin in Lebanon and “The Aztag Daily” hosted the 62nd press auditorium Friday, October 11, 2011, at the Punig Hall of “Aztag Daily.” The topic of the lecture: “The youth in Armenia and Armenian contemporary literature.”
The lecturer was Lilit Galstyan, an ARF representative in the Parliament of the Republic of Armenia.
Sarkis Giragossian opened the event on behalf of the hosts. He said the lecturer has been managing the Yerevan office of Hamazkayin in Armenia, which has been bridging Hamazkayin’s globally spread institutions with cultural life in Armenia.
He also said Ms. Galstyan is a social, political, and cultural activist.
Afterwards, Mrs. Galstyan spoke. She said that culture and politics are linked especially when a culture has politics, and politics do not exist when there is no culture at its foundations.
She added that 27 percent of the population of Armenia is the youth and 4 percent are students.
The lecturer said that today youth in Armenia are being manipulated, by becoming the tools of politicians’ interests.
Ms. Galstyan said the youth are the bearer of values, as well as the ones who weigh the rules of political and cultural games.
Ms. Galstyan also said there is a need for a revolution of values and this process can only succeed via the youth, who have already sprouted such a movement in Armenia.
She said there is a youth population gifted with contemporary values, in spite of the fact that it forms only a very small fraction of the society.
Ms. Galstyan also talked about young writers.
She highlighted the book, “Eighteen-thirty three,” published in Armenia and which features 14 young writers.
She added that “Granish,” a literary magazine geared toward youth is being published with the support of Hamazkayin. The publication’s aim is to foster the literary process in Armenia.
Ms. Galstyan affirmed that the diaspora has an important role to play in assisting Armenia to rise to new heights.
Following her lecture, Mr. Galstyan replied to questions from the audience.
Lecture։ “Trap of Glory” (Paris)
On Monday 23 February 2015, at 20:30 pm, the Paris Executive Board of the National Educational and Cultural Society organized at the Armenian House of Culture an evening of lecture about the history of the Indian-Armenian community of the 18th century and particularly, the book "Trap of Glory".
The chair of the Paris Hamazkayin’s Executive Board Hera Tosunian made an opening speech and presented the keynote speaker of the event Satenik Patvakan-Tufanian.
Philosophy teacher Satenik Patvakan-Tufanian, in 2014, defended her Doctoral dissertation on History of the Madras Indian-Armenian Community.
The topic of the dissertation was Jacob and Shahamir Shahamiryans’ book "Trap of Glory" translated into French.
It is a book of philosophy, which explains why a person should live free, in compliance with the democratic principles, respecting others’ right for freedom.
The Armenian nation, like any other nation in the world, has the right for freedom given by the God.
The book presents a program and rules for the freedom of the Armenian people.
It gives the definition of the Armenian country, explains how to divide it into areas with 12,000 houses in each. Two people should represent each area. Those representatives shall form the Armenian representatives’ house - the Parliament.
The elected representatives will govern the country.
The program even provides the control over the rulers.
Mrs. Tufanian spoke about the cultural life of the Indian Armenian community of the 18th century, renowned persons, publishing activities and commercial ties presented in the book.
She spoke about the activities of the Madras group, which believed that they would liberate Armenia and would establish Armenian State.
The lecturer confirmed the important role of the community in spreading the progressive ideas of the national liberation.
Leila Solh-Hamade, president of Walid Ben Talal Foundation, visits M. and H. Arslanian Foundation of Djemaran
The Walid Ben Talal Charity Foundation donated modern electronic appliances to the secondary school classrooms at M. and H. Arslanian Djemaran of Hamazkayin, as well as computers and electronic devices necessary for an electronic library.
Former Minister and President of the Walid Ben Talal Foundation Leila Solh-Hamade visited Djemaran on Thursday, January 20, 2011 and was welcomed by the school principal, the Central Committee of Hamazkayin, Djemaran board members, the parents’ council, teachers, staff members and students.
Following introductory words exchanged in the principal’s office, Leila Solh-Hamade went to the Norsikyan kindergarten, where she observed the children’s activities in the Green class. Upon returning to the main building of the school, she was introduced to the founders of Djemaran through their portraits and the busts displayed at the entrance.
Afterward, she visited one of the halls, where philosophy teacher Vache Dzadourian was lecturing on the usage of new possibilities in information technologies.
With great pleasure, Leila Solh-Hamade observed the class, during which the lesson was projected from a screen. She said that although the application of technologies make our life easier and increase the quality of education, it should not be exploited, since it slows the brain, and it hinders reading as well as delaying students’ normal development.
The students and the parents welcomed Leila Solh-Hamade at the Dr. Adrineh Karakashian Hall, where an art program had been prepared.
Arsho Ghazal, the Arabic teacher for the 5th Elementary Class welcomed the president of Walid Ben Talal Foundation and presented the program. A slide show of pictures featuring the foundation, transportation and development of Djemaran was presented. It also showed where former President Bshara Khoury and Prime Minister Riad Solh had honored with their presence the opening ceremony of Nshan Panaljian Djemaran in Zokak El Blat at the official opening dinner.
Dikran Jinbashian, Djemaran’s principal, welcomed this historical meeting, and reflected upon the survival and progress of Djemaran, which was founded in 1930 and survived through the years of the Lebanese Civil War. On behalf of the administration, the students, and the parents of the school, as well as of the Central Committee of Hamazkayin, he thanked the Walid Ben Talal Charity Foundation which, with its donation, supported Djemaran’s educational mission. 
Following the principal’s words, Leila Solh-Hamade thanked the school for the cordial welcome and praised the presentation of the photograph, which showed her father attending the opening of Djemaran, which was a surprise to her.
She highly appreciated the spirit of the Armenian nation, who, having lost their fatherland, know the value of freedom.
Afterwards, the principal presented Leila Solh-Hamade with a souvenir -- the torch of Djemaran, as well as the picture from the opening of Djemaran.
The art program was concluded with the dance “Yervantashad” performed by the students of the 5th Elementary Class, after which the students of the 4th Elementary Class performed an Arabic song about freedom, while Palig Aroian from the graduating class performed a Rahbanies piece on the piano.
A reception took place at the end of the event.
Let us not waste the experience
I had appealed to Roger Kharadian, the chairperson of Regional Committee of Hamazkayin in Western America, to attend a meeting to present some suggestions on behalf of the editorial staff of “Asbarez.”
Having arrived a bit early at the meeting, I was given the opportunity to take part in the discussion on some organizational issues.
On that day the Regional Committee had invited former chairpersons to take part in the meeting and was discussing its future plans together with them and requesting their advice.
These activists, who had carried the burden of the organization, not only shared their thoughts and suggestions, but also expressed their readiness to provide practical support.
The breadth of the leaders’ experience was clear in the meeting room.
Perhaps it was unnecessary on my behalf, but I wanted to absolutely appreciate the Regional Committee for respecting the former leaders and including them in discussions and activities.
The organization can only benefit from such an initiative.
Hamazkayin might not be the only organization where former leaders are appreciated and called to duty.
In any case, I did not want to lose the chance of highlighting this encouraging practice.
Usually in our public life new leaders act as if they were the first in the field and do not need the advice or help of anyone else.
That mode of action is simply a waste, thus depriving the organization of the useful input of people rich in experience.
The Regional Committee of Hamazkayin has decided not to lose this richness.
The challenging mission of developing and spreading Armenian culture demands the greatest of efforts from any organization and even the smallest contribution toward that direction will help the common cause even more.
Apo Boghigian From “Asbarez”
Letter to UNESCO
Audrey Azoulay
Director General
UNESCO
7, Place de Fontenoy,
75352 Paris 07 SP, France
Dear Ms Azoulay,
The aggressive war waged by the government of Azerbaijan on Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh), backed by Turkish forces with the participation of thousands of terrorist mercenaries, threatened native Armenians with ethnic cleansing and endangered the Armenian cultural heritage of Artsakh through the intentional destruction of cultural and religious sites.
The implementation of the recent agreement between the representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia that brought the armed conflict to a halt, will place thousands of Armenian cultural and religious sites, ancient artifacts and symbols under the jurisdiction of the authorities of Azerbaijan.
The Azerbaijani government has a documented history of conducting systematic erasure of Armenian heritage.
Over decades, the Azerbaijani authorities have demolished all traces of Armenian history and heritage in the region of Nakhichevan, including the medieval cross-stones of Djulfa and the Saint Thomas cathedral of Agulis which was founded on one of the oldest churches in the world.
In fact, during just one week of occupation of Artsakh, numerous instances of evidence emerged on the destruction of cultural monuments and the vandalism of Armenian churches and religious symbols.
This is accompanied with announcements by Azeri officials falsifying the cultural history of ancient Armenian monasteries, such as the 9th century Dadivank monastery, through forging fictitious names for its churches and denying its Armenian identity.
As a cultural association with worldwide representation and active presence for more than 90 years in the Armenian cultural life, the Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society is severely alarmed by the ongoing destruction of the cultural heritage of Artsakh and the desecration of Armenian religious sites, ancient cemeteries and cross-stones.
We are equally concerned that with the loss of ancestral land and the ensuing forced migration of the native Armenians from Artsakh, a prominent threat is posed to the loss of an ancient Armenian dialect mainly spoken in that region as well as to traditional customs and a rich indigenous heritage.
As a signatory to the World Heritage Convention, Azerbaijan has legal responsibility as a State Party to protect and conserve the world’s cultural heritage.
Purposely obliterating the cultural identity of the indigenous Armenians of Artsakh constitutes a grave crime and puts humanity’s collective culture at risk.
As the global organization with the ultimate responsibility of protecting world heritage, we urge UNESCO to take immediate action to protect all cultural monuments, artifacts, symbols and religious sites under the control of Azerbaijani authorities in Artsakh, to exert all measures to preserve the identity of these sites, to safeguard one of world’s most ancient cultures and prevent a potential cultural genocide.

Letters of Famous Writers Discussed in Toronto
Letter writing was, back in the day, the only way for individuals to communicate with each other from a distance.
Some letters are so beautifully composed that they transcend the genre and become works of literature themselves.
The letters of Daniel Varoujan, Matteos Zarifian, and Levon Shant, for example, provide us not only with historical accounts but a sense of their inner world, spiritual ups and downs, and a literary window of insight to the time of these talented people.
On November 2, 2018, at the Hamazkayin H. Manougian Library in Toronto, the Hamazkayin Book-Lovers Group held an event that allowed participants to discover a lost episode of twentieth-century Armenian literature. The heroes of the episode were Varoujan, Shant, Hamastegh, Aram Haygaz, and Ler Kamsar.
Among the book-lovers reading the letters were three teenagers.
Before the letters were read, as a short introduction, attendees heard about the book, Arvest Namakagrutyan (The art of correspondence), published in Istanbul in 1863, which taught young people how to write letters. It served to remind book lovers of the importance, back then, of letter writing.
Alik Baboghlian is one of the new members of the group. After sharing some of Varoujan’s life story, he dove into the poet’s letters.
A letter to his future wife, Araksi Tashjian, hints at their tumultuous relationship. He shows boundless love and a firm commitment to marry her.
In a letter to his paternal uncle, he seeks blessings for the “torch of the future”: “For this word of blessing, ‘success,’ I shamelessly beg you, but I have no doubt that you will bestow it.”
Writing to author Arshag Chobanian, the young Varoujan expresses gratitude for Chobanian’s encouraging words.
The letters reflect three important moments in the writer’s life, but they are also a joy to read with their rich and image-laden writing.
Levon Shant, the “Consummate Armenian,” Remembered in Toronto
“Whoever is defeated, naturally, pulls out of the arena; whoever is exhausted takes a seat. But that changes nothing.
New fighters replace those who pull out; others rise to take the place of those who sit down.
And if today we all pull out of the arena, tomorrow members of the new generation will rise, holding the old flag up high in their hands because they too want to live their national life.”
Levon Shant’s words crystalize the great Armenian’s deeply held belief in the new generation. A generation that he created, that passed on to the one that followed its passion for soaring ever higher; a generation that today continues its committed steps, “holding the old flag up high.”
On March 1, 2020, Toronto Armenians have the opportunity to experience a singular day, a celebration, by the Hamazkayin Kladzor Chapter, of Levon Shant—playwright, pedagogue, a president of the National Assembly of the first Republic of Armenia, a founder of Hamazkayin and of the Djemaran in Beirut.
At the entrance of the Hamazkayin Theatre at the Toronto Armenian Youth Centre, guests look at an object covered in a veil. The covering is white, with birds embroidered in blue thread.
Inside, from the stage, Shant’s profile greets the guests. Under it is his signature and the dates 1869–1951.
The lights dim and the emcee, chapter secretary Shogher Jelladian, reads a brief biography. Shant was born in Istanbul.
His birth name was Levon Nahashbedian (Seghposian). He attended the local school in Üsküdar (Scutari).
He lost his parents as a child and was sent to Ejmiadzin alongside other young men, including Gomidas, to attend the Gevorgian Seminary.
After his studies, he returned to Istanbul and started writing under the name of Shant.
The Hairenik published his satiric novella, “Mnak Parovi Irigune” (The evening of goodnight), as well as his first poems.
He moved to Germany, where he studied for seven years. He took courses in pedagogy, psychology, and natural sciences and continued to write.
In 1899, Levon Shant moved to the Caucasus and worked as a teacher while also part of Hovhannes Tumanian’s Vernatun literary circle in Tiflis.
Shant returned to Istanbul but moved, in 1913, to Europe and thus was spared death in the Catastrophe.
In 1919, he was elected to the National Assembly of the Republic of Armenia and became a president of the parliament.
After Armenia became a Soviet republic, Shant moved first to Persia, then to France; he taught and wrote for four years in Marseille.
He was then invited to Alexandria to teach at the Boghosian national school; the principal was Nigol Aghpalian, the literary critic.
In Cairo, in 1928, alongside a group of intellectuals, he established the Hamazkayin publishing and cultural association.
A year later Shant and Aghpalian moved to Beirut, where, in 1930, Shant founded the Armenian Djemaran.
He served as principal until his death at the age of 82.
Edgar Baghdasarian’s “Prelude” begins the artistic program for the day. The pianist is Antoinette Manoogian, the talented granddaughter of the musician Hagop Manoogian.
In a glorious velvet dress and with proud steps, Maria Manoogian, well known for dancing with the Hamazkayin Erepuni Ensemble, takes the stage. Azat Gharibian directs a performance of the pleasant “Akhaltsikhe” to extended applause.
The musician Vanig Hovhannesian has transformed Shant’s poem “Anush Hovig” into a song.
Sarine Sarkisian of the Hamazkayin Kousan Choir gives a delicate interpretation of the song, accompanied by Mr. Hovhannesian on piano. The applause is enthusiastic.
A video, “Kaghdni Tghtabanag” (Secret file) is shown. Now Central Executive Board member Dr. Viken Tufenkjian, invited especially from Montreal, delivers a keynote.
Dr. Tufenkjian has served in various capacities in the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and Hamazkayin.
Director of the Hamazkayin Bedros Atamian Theatrical Group is one of those capacities.
His Holiness Aram I, catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia, has awarded Dr. Tufenkjian with the Mesrob Mashtots Medal for his dedicated educational, social, and cultural activity.
He holds a Ph.D. in English from the Université de Montréal, where he also studied education.
“It is beyond doubt,” Dr. Tufenkjian says, “that Shant, who opened new paths in the fields of literature, pedagogy, philosophy, and national life, is one of the shining intellectual stars in the Armenian firmament. We must, therefore, pay our debt of respect to Levon Shant and accord him his place in Armenian literature.”
In Beirut, Dr. Tufenkjian says, more than ten thousand mourners attended his funeral, but in Armenia he was sadly labeled “an anti-Armenian zealot.”
The reason, he says, was the literary atmosphere of the time, forced by the ideologues of the Communist Party of the Armenian SSR.
What is sadder, he adds, is that thirty years after Armenia regained its independence, when Tumanian and Gomidas are remembered with numerous public celebrations, there is hardly a mention of the great satirist Yervant Odian and a mere two conferences about Shant, with scant attendance.
“Shant has always been variously labeled an inaccessible, Western Armenian, godless, or philosophical writer,” he added.
The chairperson of the Hamazkayin Central Executive Board, Dr. Megerdich Megerdichian, has called Shant “the consummate Armenian,” Dr. Tufenkjian recalls.
Shant brought together in his person the Western Armenian of his birth, the Eastern Armenian of his life in the Caucasus, along with his European higher education, to create a unique, unifying figure in the Armenian world.
Turning to Shant’s plays, it’s easy to see his idealism and aspirations for all humanity.
Tufenkjian mentions a few of Shant’s works to point out that Shant’s heroes never lose hope, don’t get emotional, and always aspire upward.
“Shant brought an entirely novel mentality to modern Armenian literature; understanding it required intellectual capacity and unambiguous dedication,” Dr. Tufenkjian says.
“This is probably one of Shant’s alleged crimes. Say we were not ready for his novel worldview a hundred years ago; but not even today?”
The literary critic Hagop Oshagan didn’t have much praise for Levon Seghposian’s work or heroes back then. “What story do they tell? What people do they belong to?” Oshagan wrote, excluding Shant’s heroes from the Armenian people.
The speaker adds interesting details about Shant’s beliefs about the Armenian language and tells stories about Shant’s personal discipline and industry.
He confesses, however, that what interests him the most is the attention Shant lavishes on self-knowledge.
He wraps up by saying that Shant is a one-off; seventy years after his death he continues to draw us to his thoughts through the symbolism of his works and the currency of his thoughts.
The keynote allows guests to open new windows into their knowledge of Levon Shant the man and the writer.
The emcee gives Dr. Tufenkjian a copy of Matthew Karanian’s most recent book as a gift.
The stage is dark. In utter silence, we hear Moushegh Karakashian’s deep voice. Aren Mnatsakanian, the “Night Watchman,” walks across the stage, his footsteps sounding like a ticking grandfather clock.
He remembers his childhood. In the spotlight we can see children sitting cross-legged and a grandmother is telling them about the legendary Mher.
The actors started at the Hamazkayin M. and H. Arslanian Djemaran and are now students at the ARS Day School here: Lori Berberian, Varak Mesrobian, and Narod Kelebozian.
There is moving recorded music and the movements of the actors and their facial expressions capture the imagination of the guests.
“Kisherabahe” (Night watchman) is among Shant’s more penetrating stories. It demonstrates his unwavering will to soar above the painful circumstances of everyday life.
We turn the page. This time it is the harp that grabs our hearts.
Vani Yacoubian, Lana Der Bedrossian and Dzila Kouyoumdjian Kourjakian of the Hamazkayin Erepuni Dance Ensemble are wearing flowing costumes and their coordinated movements create harmony in the eyes of the guests.
The dance teacher and artistic director Nelly Karapetyan is to be congratulated.
Levon Shant’s character of “praising the life of the ideal” is once again demonstrated in the story, “Yes Badranke Siretsi” (I loved the deceit).
Lori Berberian recites the piece with clear diction and understanding.
At the conclusion of the artistic program, the emcee invites the chairperson of the chapter executive board, and of the literary committee, Tamar Donabedian Kuzuian, the sculptor Hagop Janbazian, and his wife Juliette Janbazian to the stage.
Mr. Janbazian created the bust of Shant and is one of the donors to the project. His works are on display in Armenia and in Canada, the United States, Lebanon, and Israel.
Ms. Donabedian Kuzuian presents the couple with a painting by Samuel Tavadyan, a young artist from Artsakh, as a token of the community’s appreciation.
She also expresses words of deep gratitude to donors Dr. Ani Hasserjian and Levon Hasserjian, who aren’t present.
The time has come. At the entrance to the theatre, Dr. Tufenkian, Ms. Donabedian Kuzuian, and ARF Toronto Gomideh chairperson Sevag Kupelian unveil Levon Shant’s bust to enthusiastic applause.
Levon Shant has found his worthy place in the Toronto Armenian Youth Centre, across from the Armenian school, at the entrance to the Hamazkayin Theatre. How very fitting. Even the date is fitting, as the Djemaran Shant established in Beirut turns 90 this month.
Mr. Janbazian delivers an emotional address. Coffee and kata are served.
It is an emotional moment. Shant’s face smiles at all of us.
Let Shant serve as a source of inspiration to each of us to aspire to the best, never losing hope, living a virtuous life as an Armenian, laying claim to Armenian culture, Armenian schools, and the Armenian language.
T.D.
Levon Shant’s 150 Years Celebrated in Armenia
On May 3, 2019, the Hamazkayin Yerevan office and the Fridtjof Nansen Museum marked Levon Shant’s sesquicentennial.
Among the intellectuals and book lovers in attendance were the students of the L. Shant School in Yerevan and the students of the Getik village school in the Gegharkunik province.
Museum trustee Anahid Vardanyan spoke about Shant’s literary legacy and especially his book, Hin Astvatzner (Old gods).
Hamazkayin Central Executive Board member Spartak Karabakhtsian reflected briefly on Shant’s character and announced that a book dedicated to the great writer would soon be published by Hamazkayin.
Hagop Balian, a public intellectual and pedagogue from France, spoke about Shant’s legacy as an educator.
He said an important creation of Shant’s, “Shghtaivadz” (Chained) has a lot of contemporary relevance; he urged the students to remain connected to the homeland, and not to abandon the soil or the spirit.
Audience members were also given an opportunity to speak.
At the end of the event, the schoolchildren were given books published by Hamazkayin and the Nansen museum.
Levon Shant’s Sesquicentennial Celebrated in Aleppo
Levon Shant’s sesquicentennial was celebrated in Aleppo on November 29, 2019, under the aegis of Bishop Masis Zobuian, Prelate of the Armenian Diocese of Syria, in an event organized by Hamazkayin’s Aleppo “Nigol Aghpalian” Chapter. The event took place, aptly, at the Levon Shant Hall of Aleppo’s Aram Manoukian House
The event was a literary evening, attended by the prelate, as well as Rev. Manoug Barikhanian, members of the Hamazkayin Regional Executive Board, the chapter board, and fans of literature.
The event included an artistic program.
Krist Karamanyan and Sevan Deirmenjian served as emcees.
Rosette Abejian, chairperson of the chapter board, made an opening speech reflecting on the importance of Shant’s literary and cultural work. She said, “It is this philosopher and pathbreaker—who defined the diaspora, revived the intelligentsia, preserved and disseminated Armenian culture—that we celebrate tonight; his dedicated efforts and cultural vision were realized in the worldwide activity of Hamazkayin over the past 90 years.
As an expression of gratitude and respect, the Hamazkayin Aleppo “Nigol Aghpalian” Chapter Executive Board, with the support of the Literary, Music, and Dance Committees, organized this sesquicentennial celebration in memory of the Armenian intellectual and Hamazkayin founder.”

Literary Evening (Kuwait)
On Friday, December 15, 2017, the literary-educative committee of Hamazkayin Kuwait once again organized a literary evening for the Kuwaiti Armenian book lovers at the newly built St.Vardanants Church of Kuwait. This time the event was dedicated to one of the greatest figures of the Armenian literature of the 20th century-Yeghishe Charents, the 120th anniversary of his birthday and 80th anniversary of his death.
The essential element of this evening was the beautiful Christmas tree decorated with books.
Angela Sarkissian opened the program, after which the audience followed Narine Arapatlyan’s beautiful arrangement from The Tagharan by Charents, and also the poet’s another masterpiece – the song My Sweet Armenia by Atom Keheyan and Vatche Tashjian.
Then, a 15-minute video film called The Great Genius - Yeghishe Charents was screened. It was scrupulously made by the committee members in Armenia with the assistance of the RA Ministry of Culture and the Hamazkayin Armenia Office through visiting the House-Museum of Charents and interviewing the prominent scholars of Charents.
After the screening, the audience enjoyed Hakob Tadoian's song Until Tomorrow, Maria Sarkissian’s recitation Soma, Garo Boghosyan’s Pepo’s Song on duduk, and Mayda Movsesian's recitation of the poet’s horrific Death Phantom.
Eventually, George Arapatlyan briefly analyzed Charents’ literary path until his tragic death. He focused on the poet's patriotism and bold truth speaking at the time when Stalin's axe was reaping the Armenian intellectuals, and there was a great threat for the poet’s life.
At the end of the evening, Prelate, Very Rev Masis Zoboyan emphasized Charents' patriotism, which fully expressed his nation's feelings, highly appreciated the organizing committee, and expressed hope that such evenings would be organized frequently in our community life.
Literary evening and book-wining (UAE)

Catholicos Aram I proclaimed this year the year of Armenian books.
Faithful to its mission of promoting Armenian literature and supporting the servants of Armenian education, the Levon Shant distinct committee of Hamazkayin organized a literary evening on Saturday, February 4, 2012, at the Pierre Keosseyian Hall in Sharjah. On this occasion, writer and intellectual Berjuhi Avedian from Aleppo spoke on the topic of “The role of women in Armenian literature.”
The event also served as a launch for Ms. Avedian’s “Pemahartag” (“Platform”).
On behalf of the committee of the Moushegh Ishkhan Chapter, Seta Mangassarian spoke, followed by an art program. Sarin Giragossian and Hasmig Bedrikjian, students of the Ohannessian Armenian School, performed on the piano and the violin.

Mrs. Snabian presented Andranik Petrosyan and invited him to speak about his book ″The Armenian-Turkish Issue″.
The writer introduced his research work, in which he had analysed the work and ideological basis of the Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission of 2001.
The author concluded that the preferred way of the peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Turkish conflict was the dialogue between the two peoples’ civil societies, and it could be developed through art and literature.
It is worth mentioning that Andranik Petrosian has dedicated this book to his unforgettable and beloved wife, Khatun Temizdjian.
The writer introduced his books Towards the Meeting and Sh, taking the audience to Lebanon (Western Beirut) and then, to Shushi.

As an alternative, Varduhi Vardanyan's "Garot" was presented to the audience.
Haytoug Chamlian had chosen Harut Pambukjian's "Vank" (1975) and Talin Latoyan had chosen the song "Blown Cherry Tree".

Maratug Shares His Views on Hamazkayin in Toronto on its Fiftieth Anniversary
I opened my eyes for the first time and what I saw was Hamazkayin, the Hamazkayin Vahe Setian Press, the Hamazkayin Nshan Palanjian Djemaran (Lyceum), Bookstore, Kasbar Ipegian Theater Company, Vasburagan Hall, choir, dance group, Armenian Studies institute, all in Beirut.
I opened my eyes and saw Armenians.
When, as a teenager, I moved to Toronto, I naturally gravitated toward the Hamazkayin H. Manougian Library. Taniel Varuzhan, Paruyr Sevak, Rupen Sevag, Metsarents, and Charents were there. Our literature and our language.
Naturally, I found myself with the Hamazkayin George Sarkisian Theatre, where I found Levon Shant, Shirvanzade, and Baronian.
And I was with the Hamazkayin Erebuni dancers, listening to the footfalls of our ancestors, watching Charents’s “Yes im anush Hayastani” come to life.
I was with the Hamazkayin Kusan choir, listening to Gomidas.
I was at the Hamazkayin Arshile Gorky Gallery, the Hamazkayin Pomegranate Film Festival, where our imagination soared.
A vision of Armenian culture living on throughout the diaspora motivated the founders of Hamazkayin—Shant, Aghpalian, Ohanjanian, Ipegian, on May 28, 1928. That same vision motivated the founders of the Toronto (later “Klatsor”) Chapter, Jirair Hovhannesian, Apkar Mirakian, Vahe Mardirosian, Shoushig Boyadjian, and Nerses Gedikian in 1969.
Fifty years later, on December 8, 2019, at the Toronto Armenian Youth Centre, the community celebrated. The event was under the aegis of the Regional Executive Board for Canada.
Blue, gold, and silver balloons decorated the entrance. Inside, we saw beautiful decorations made in workshops held for the younger and older members of the chapter.
A dazzling selection of photographs is on the right. Also, flyers from past events, a curated mound of books representing over a hundred book talks.
At the entrance of the theater, copies of a book prepared by Jirayr Petrosian, celebrating the fifty years of the chapter.
Marie Rose Abousefian presented “ Dikran Medz” one man show, incarnating 14 different roles
On Saturday, October 3rd, 2015, at the Hagop Der Melkonian theatre Hall in Lebanon, Hamazkayin Lebanon’s Central Executive organized an event where locally acclaimed artist, publicist and poet Marie Rose Abousefian presented the one man show “Dikran Medz”.
Marie Rose Abousefian, who wrote and directed the play based herself on Berj Zeitountsian’s “Asdoudzo 12 ore” play, her knowledge of the Armenian history, as well as her personal thoughts and analysis.
The publically admired star welcomed the audience and expressed her gratitude to Hamazkayin Lebanon Central Executive.
Regarding “Dikran Medz” she stated that in the past, this area was war-torn and the people had appealed to Dikran Medz to come to their aid, successfully liberating and conquering the area and marking it part of his kingdom. She continued by adding that it’s true, Dikran Medz is no longer here to save the area from its complicated state, however there are his Armenian heirs who have inherited his will.
Marie Rose pointed out that Dirkan Medz had inherent love and patriotism towards his people and motherland.
She informed those present that whatever information we have today of Dikran Medz comes from external sources, seeing that Armenian sources, considered pagan or heathen, were destroyed once Christianity became the official faith of the country.
Abousefian said: “ Living in the United States, it is impossible to not think about great political power, consequently, in “Dikran Medz” I’m mostly basing myself on this same idea of great political power.

Martyr Writers’ Anthology in English (US)

All of them were the victims of 1915, except, Intra, killed in 1921.
The first event dedicated to the Armenian Genocide was organized on January 23, 2015; in the Armenian House of Queens by the Hamazkayin New York Chapter and the St. Gregory the Illuminator Church of New York City.
The conductor of the event was Zarmine Poghosyan. Priest Mesrop Lakseian delivered the opening speech.

Master’s program in Armenian Studies
The process of providing forthcoming Armenian generations with a solid and valuable Armenian education requires specialized and competent teachers.
Throughout the Armenian Diaspora, the number of qualified candidates for positions in teaching Armenian has gradually decreased in recent years.
If this trend continues, Armenian schools will be confronting a major crisis in the near future.
In April 2012, we had announced by a press release that in our effort to find a solution to this problem, we had begun collaborating with Yerevan State University, in order to establish a Master’s program in Armenian Studies. The program would aim at preparing educators skilled in teaching Armenian and Armenian History in diaspora schools.
At this time, we are pleased to announce that the Hamazkayin Central Executive Board has co-signed a special agreement with YSU, where the M.A. in Armenian Studies program has been deployed.
It is a two-year program with courses encompassing Western Armenian, Armenian literature, history, and culture.
At the same time, we remind potential applicants to the program that the Hamazkayin Central Executive Board has established a scholarship that will cover tuition fees at all levels, as well as living expenses while studying in Armenia. The program is comprised of three phases:
We would like to invite students who have graduated or are about to graduate from Armenian schools and are interested in the program to contact the Hamazkayin Central Executive Board by writing to central@hamazkayin.com, or by calling 00961-4-715684.
We invite all Armenian schools in the diaspora to disseminate the above.

Armenian Hall” of the Levon Shant Cultural Center in Beirut on March 29, 2019. The celebration featured the debut of Garo Avesian’s “Yerek hayren Kuchaken” (Three hayrens from Kuchak).
The event was organized by the Hamazkayin Parsegh Ganachian Conservatory. Vahram Emmiyan, director of the conservatory, made opening remarks. He spoke of the value of music. “Music is higher than every search for meaning; it opens doors that words cannot open.
Music is not tangible and so it rises into the sky, approaching the infinite. That is why music is an inescapable part of religious rites; it is the language of the angels and reaches the ears of God directly, taking with it the words and the sweet-smelling incense.”
He also said that music penetrates the human soul, changes one’s mood, heals, and is born in the depths of its creator’s soul. He claimed that it is more effective when it is of good quality and is performed by the composer.
Building on these assertions, Emmiyan promised the audience a treat because the composer of “Yerek hayren Kuchaken” would participate in the performance.
He said that in addition to the debut of the musical work, the author of the lyrics, Kuchak, would be remembered.

"We can testify any case.
However, can we testify any testimony violation?
Is it a case similar to others?
It is the question, which the person asks to himself when appearing in such a situation. Only he can ask that question.

Memorial Evening for Boghos Shahmelikian Held in Los Angeles
Each of his books was a catalyst for a new way of thinking, toward new worldviews, toward new and often unique philosophies.
Each of his books was a window into life, humanity, seeing the world anew, perceiving, feeling it.
A person living in today’s materialist world would be lucky to be freed of the complex of material criteria for success, shallow values, and rise to the level of needing to read a book now and then, to learn of an author’s inner world, and to convey this insight to others, especially young people.
To portray life as it is.
To shower respect and gratitude upon all those who are loved and respected.
To express boundless love for his beloved place of birth, Lebanon, and particularly Bourj Hammoud, where he spent his childhood and youth.
To speak of the local grocer, those who come and go, not to forget a detail.
And still... .
We speak of a man who left us forever just a few months ago, and left us his works as a balm for the pain and regret, the terrible sadness.
We speak of a man who loved everyone with his simple and unrestrained personality and was loved by many.
His personality was such that people who did not know him were drawn to him and became his friends.

Monthly Children’s Story Hour Takes Place in Montreal
On April 26, 2019, the monthly “Books are our friends, stories are our imaginations” children’s story hour took place in Montreal, hosted by Hamazkayin’s local Sanahin chapter.
At the beginning of the story hour, leader Meghri Bakarian invited the children to color the Armenian flag.
After they were done coloring, the children proudly waved red, blue, and orange.
Then, they took their seats in anticipation of hearing “Varag g’aytsele Hayastan.”
The excited children, through the words of the book, were taken to their motherland: to the city of Yerevan, to Tsitsernakaberd, and to other historic places, learning about Armenian mores and traditions.
After the story, there was some discussion and education about April 24th and why it is regarded as important in Armenian culture.
Next, with the assistance of Meghri, the children attempted to write stories of their own.
Taking turns, each child added an idea or a sentence to the emerging story. With lots of imagination, and some help from the adults, the children managed to create three unique and fun stories.
At the end of the gathering, everyone proudly sang the Armenian national anthem.
Montreal Armenian Studies Program Starts Second Semester
On January 22, 2022, the “Levon Shant” Armenian Studies Program organized by Hamazkayin in Montral started a new phase.
Braving the exceptionally cold weather of that day and in spite of the limitations imposed because of the pandemic, more than 20 students attended the first lesson of the second semester.
The topic for the day was the difference between Armenian classical orthography and the Abeghian orthography in use in Armenia and beyond. The speaker was Vrej-Armen Artinian.
In the days before the lecture, students had received Silva Kaputikyan’s “Khosk in vordun” (Address to my son) poem in both orthographies. Their homework was to note the differences.
The speaker first reflected on various theories about the origins of Armenian language and located Armenian within the family of languages.
Artinian discussed the evolution of the Armenian alphabet, starting with prehistoric hieroglyphs and cuneiform, noting the relationship of the Armenian alphabet with the Ethiopian Ge’ez script, culminating with the invention of the alphabet in the fifth century of the common era.
The oldest artifact showing the alphabet is on the door of the Degor monatery and shows these 36 letters.
Artinian also noted that the alphabet doubled as a number system.
In the second part of the lecture, Artinian discussed the later evolution of the alphabet. There were unremarkable changes after the addition of the letters Օ (O) and Ֆ (F) until 1922, when the newly established Soviet government of Armenia “reformed” the orthography (spelling rules) of the language, largely for political reasons.
The changes were based on recommendations made in 1913 by scholar Manuk Abeghian and rejected by the scholarly community.
Artinian noted that some of the changes imposed in 1922 were retracted in 1940. At that time, the letters է and Օ were reinstated. The classical rule that the letter Ո at the start of a word reads vo was reinstated, as the alternative, spelling out վո (v, o) was cumbersome. Likewise, the classical rule that the letter Ե at the start of a word reads ye was reinstated, as the alternative, spelling out Յե (y, e) was also cumbersome.
Artinian also noted that in Armenia on October 9, 1996, the state adopted the following as the official Armenian alphabet.

More that 150.000 US Dollars to M. & H. Arslanian Djemaran
The annual banquet of Hamazkayin M. & H. Arslanian Djemaran, presided by Mr. and Mrs. Maral Kiurkchians, took place on Friday, April 7, 2017, at The Villa Hall. Ambassador of the Republic of Armenia, Samvel Mkrtchyan, Mayors of Anjar and Bourj Hammoud city, representatives of official bodies and unions, special guests, parents, teachers and Djemaran graduates were present at the banquet.
Djemaran graduates Vahan Manjigian Kaprielian and Njdeh Meguerditchian conducted the banquet.
Djemaran Principal, Paula Yeghiayian delivered a speech at the beginning of the event saying, "For its successful long-life activity Djemaran owes to the human resource strengthening the school.
When I say human resource, first and foremost, I mean the army of devoted teachers, which selflessly and with ample patience make great efforts for student formation.
When I say human resource, I mean all those parents that send their children to Djemaran believing in the sacred mission of the Armenian school.
When I say human resource, I mean the numerous of Djemaran’s friends who are always there. They support the school in difficult situations, feel joy when it succeeds, and always support it financially and morally.
Finally, when I say human resource, I refer to the large cluster of Djemaran graduates from Lebanon or elsewhere, who are always ready to support Djemaran.″
After presenting some programs aimed at Djemaran’s prosperity, Paula Yeghiayian ended her speech by saying, "For implementing School Programs we are looking forward to your moral and material support.
Today, once again, let’s commence new major projects with the help of your donations.
We turn to you with great confidence, because we know that together we can keep the torch of Djemaran alive."
Then Paula Yeghiayian invited Chair of Hamazkayin Central Executive Board, Mguerditch Mguerditchian to make a speech.
He said, "In developed and healthy societies the state naturally and perhaps takes care of education and culture.
In our case, the Armenian state has not so far been able to assume this important national obligation in its own interests.
The Diaspora has no state structure.
No matter how organized it is, the Diaspora can not substitute any state body.
In such conditions, volunteers assume the lion's share of work."
After speaking about the enduring financial difficulties faced by the educational and cultural institutions, Mguerditch Mguerditchian said, "The schools and cultural centers are of no use without capable teachers and talented artists and can even turn into harmful institutions. Furthermore, constructing such schools and cultural centers without significant financial contribution is a real nightmare.
In our reality, the existence of donors has become an imperative need. Their act of benevolence in the form of willfully provided national duty is not only a donated financial support, but has also moral value.
That's why it deserves more appreciation from the public."
At the end of his speech, he honored Mr. & Mrs. Hovig and Maral Kiurkchian, the material support of which serves to the promotion of the Hamazkayin Educational, publishing and cultural activities, with the Medal of Hamazkayin Central Committee.
Violinist Y. Karakhanian, native singer Gohar Muratian and the band inspired the guests performing folk and patriotic songs.
The banquet organized in support of Djemaran’s continual progress ended with great success.
Dear organizers, you have got it made!
During the banquet, the donations reached more than 150.000 US Dollars.
Thanks to Djemaran’s huge family, which supports this educational institution materially or morally.
We express our special thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Hovig and Maral Kiurkchian for their generous donation and for assuming the presiding of the event.

The ministries of culture and diaspora affairs of Armenia had given him an award as “Defender of the Mother Tongue.”

On concerts by Zvartnots Choir (Syria)
Music is as ancient as language and the Armenian nation.
As a guardian and protector of the Armenian language and culture, their preservation is of vital importance to Hamazkayin, the greatest national wealth, a cultural verve and a power giving genuine strength and spirit to the generation next.
After months of consistent and intense rehearsals, the Zvartnots Choir of Hamazkayin performed for the Armenian community in Aleppo. The two concerts took place on the evenings of 5 and 6 March 2011 and were sponsored by His Grace Bishop Shahan Sarkissian, the Prelate of the Diocese of Aleppo.
Following both THE Syrian and Armenian national hymns, Alin Momjian delivered an opening speech in Armenian and Arabic. Afterward, the Choir performed a series of folk songs familiar to the audience.
It was a profound pleasure to listen to the songs of Gomidas, then to arias from Carrmina Burana and from Verdi’s opera. The two patriotic songs performed in Arabic were also appreciated.
A special performance of five songs by Sayat Nova is the peak of these annual concerts.
Those songs were dedicated to the 200th birth anniversary of Sayat Nova, an offering from the heart of Hamazkayin to the memory of the poet singer. The three patriotic songs concluded the concert with their impressive performance.
The concerts were a success and the audience appreciated the choir who had given all their time and efforts to accomplish the mission trusted in them.
If songs are a treasure that through national and artistic education ennoble and alleviate the soul, then the formation of this choir and the consistent rehearsals are a school for its members.
In it, they acquire skills of team work, love and awareness of national values, which is a blessing for our far away communities.
With these dual qualities Zvartnots Choir deserves special appreciation.
We warmly congratulate Davit Poghosyan, a talented choirmaster and conductor from Armenia, who featured his choir with a quality program.
We also appreciate the committee of the choir unit, whose members had dedicated their time and efforts for the success of the concerts

Pakin
The Central Executive Board of Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Institution announces that Pakin, established in 1962, enters a new stage this year.
For the past 54 years, the Armenian diaspora’s elite has found in Pakin a creative and philological platform on which, alongside established names, were formed successive generations.
Pakin, shaped by Garo Sassouni, Yetvart Boyajian, and Boghos Snabian, is the diaspora’s longest living and most respected publication.
In 2003, following the aforementioned predecessors, Hagop Balian assumed the editorship of the magazine and, for the following twelve years, concentrated his intellectual energy on the magazine, ensuring its continuous publication, and therefore caring for the preservation of the Western Armenian literary atmosphere.
He brought to Pakin young collaborators who continue to contribute to the magazine.
In 2015, Hagop Balian submitted to the Central Executive Board of Hamazkayin his request for retirement, which was granted.
We thank Hagop Balian for his contribution to Pakin.
Pakin is now entering a fresh period of transition.
The Central Executive Board of Hamazkayin is pleased to announce that, as of 1 January 2016, it has appointed Sonia Kilejian-Ajemian as editor-in-chief, and Nora Parseghian as assistant editor.
Alongside them will be serving an editorial advisory board consisting of: Christian Padiguian, Maroush Yeramian, Viken Tufenkjian, Hagop Gullujian, Avedis Hajian, Shaghig Meguerditchian, Vartan Madteosian, Arkmenig Nigoghosian, Aram Batchian, Sevan Deyirmenjian, Mirna Douzjian, and Haroutyun Kurkjian.
The first combined issue of Pakin will appear in July 2016.
The Central Executive Board of Hamazkayin is confident that the newly appointed editor-in-chief, assistant editor, and editorial advisory board will continue to strengthen their predecessors’ tradition by contributing to the preservation of Western Armenian, to the channeling of artistic and philological efforts in the diaspora and in Armenia, and to the resonance of intellectual message.

Panel discussion regarding Lebanese-Armenian and Istanbul-Armenian reality in Literature. (Lebanon)
Hamazkayin Lebanon’s Central Executives organized an event on Sunday, October 11, 2015 at the Hamazkayin Levon Shant centre’s “K. and H. Armenian” hall. The evening entailed a discussion regarding the portrayal of Lebanese- Armenian and Turkish-Armenian reality in our literature.
The panellists were Norvan Archbishop Zakarian, Krikor Beledian, Haroutioun Kurkdjian and Sevan Deyrmedjian.
The opening remarks were given by Shaghig Mgrditchian.
She remarked by using Krikor Beledian’s books as reference that how much our environment impacts our creative output, and the influence our surroundings have on literature and to what point does it show in writings.
Norvan Archbishop Zakarian was the first panellist. He started by taking a glance at the year 1975 when Lebanon was in civil war, and Krikor Beledian, who was living in Paris at the time, influenced by those events wrote Topography for a City Being Destroyed.
Archbishop Zakarian stated that this is a work of grand esteem and quality by Beledian that shows the author’s wit and mastermind.
He read a passage from the book that represented Beirut’s reality. He pointed out that Beledian’s creative genius and abilities are prominent in his work, because for a brief moment, readers believe that Beledian was himself in Beirut writing this work, yet in reality he was miles away in Paris.
Summing up his thoughts, Archbishop Zakarian said that Beledian has represented the Lebanese-Armenian community’s reality through his literary work.
Following Archbishop Zakarian, Roubina Mgrditchian read from the book “Sermer” and presented a brief analysis.
Paris Blue House Celebrates its First Year
There was a lot of joy and cheer on June 18, 2022, at the House of Armenian Culture in Paris, from the ground floor up to the Demirian Hall on the second floor.
A beautiful spread was provided in different shades of blue to celebrate the end of the first academic year of the Blue House.
The Blue House is a workshop for transmitting Armenian language, culture, and history to children through games, songs, and handicrafts. It is in session two hours a week.
Hamazkayin-Paris initiated the Blue House at the request of several parents.
In spite of the uncertainty generated by the pandemic, Hamazkayin was able to organize two classes, one for children 3–4 years old and the other for children 5–7 years old. Rosine Tachdjian and Nonig Hovhannesian are the teachers. They are assisted by four helpers.
The vast majority of the children are not Armenian speakers, which makes for a lot of effort.
It was a terribly hot day (38°C or 100°F) but the children and their parents all showed up.
Nonig Hovhannesian opened with remarks in Armenian, thanking the parents for their presence and for their trust, encouragement, and steadfastness.
She said the goal was to bring the children into an Armenian environment and show them that even though we live in the diaspora, we have inherited a history, language, and script.
She announced that there will be a third class next year.
Lori Baghdasarian, a parent, said the following in French: “Hamazkayin-Paris was able to make our dream come true, bring our children under the very roof where we learned Armenian in the Blue Cross Armenian classes.
Everything became possible because of the enthusiasm and sustained efforts of our friend Sevag Torossian.”
After the opening remarks, Rosine Tachdjian led the younger children in singing “Pari luys” (Good morning) with their napkins waving. They then acted in the comedy Shoghgam (Turnip), with each child having a role.
The older children played the main heroes of the Armenian epic Sasuntsi Davit, each revealing their identity using posters prepared in Armenian and French by their teacher Nonig Hovhannesian with Garen Jinbachian.
At the end of the program, the children, teachers, and parents made a circle and sang, off previously printed lyrics, “Menk manugner hayots azki” (We children of the Armenian nation) and “Tsdesutiun” (Au revoir).
At the end of the celebration food was served as the parents took the opportunity to socialize.
This comment was overheard: “Here my son felt at ease. He has no complexes; he sees there are Armenian children like him who don’t speak Armenian but want to learn it. It pleases me that he will also have Armenian friends.”
And this one: “I am glad my daughter got used to an Armenian atmosphere and Armenian school and that is now part of her weekly routine.”
Hearing all this, I asked myself, “Isn’t this a large part of the purpose of the Hamazkayin-Paris initiative?”
We wish the Blue House success for many years to come.

It is worth mentioning that such great number of young people have never participated in any performances so far.
20-25 active young people united and succeeded.
At the end of the performance, Com. Azniv Ingilizian thanked the organizers and actors for their sincere dedication, coommittment and efforts.
She invited to the stage the distinguished actress Lucy Varpetian to speak about each participant of the performance and appreciate the work of each of them.
The Hamazkayin "Nubar Khachadourian" Theatrical Troupe with its main and new actors, once again managed to record excellent results. The smiling faces of the people leaving the hall after the performance spoke about the success.
Performance Crane Calling (USA)
On Sunday, November 5, 2017, we enjoyed the Crane Calling performance, sponsored by the Hamazkayin association and directed by Tsolak Khacherian.
Many of us had enjoyed this drama more than once since the 70s when the Hamazkayin's Kaspar Ipegian troupe toured to various Armenian communities of the Diaspora, including Aleppo, Damascus, Gamishli and presenting the performance staged by George Sarkissian. The performance fascinated everyone then.
The Crane Calling from Homeland was a sobering alarm for many. The breath taking melody of the song by Gomidas made the listeners anxious and at the same time sober. It is the soul touching call of the crane symbolizing the Homeland of all Armenians.
The author of the play 101-year-old Jack S. Hagopian came to the theater on Sunday, and after having watched the performance attentively, delivered a speech and expressed his appreciation to the Hamazkayin Association, Kaspar Ipegian Company, director, actors and of course to spectators.
The level of the performance was higher than being an amateur performance, and the play of some actors was unbelievably successful. Therefore, it left a hope that such plays that Diaspora Armenians need would be staged more often in the future.
The drama was about the life of a Diasporan family that migrated to Australia in 40s.
The resettlement motivated the family's father, Margar Hagopian to be alienated and be far away from the Armenian community as a vengeance for his being a rejected Armenian writer in the past.
His past, that had left a wound in his heart, (the first volume of his poems was ignored), became a reason for denying his nation and changing his name (Mark Jackson) in the new city and new environment.
A father of another family, Kevork Artsruni (Tsolak Khatcherian), with a much fierce patriotism, at every cost struggles against the assimilation, by organizing a meeting and establishing a new union for the sake of preserving the Armenian identity.
The meeting showed intolerance and disagreement as a consequence of discord.
His wife, Srbuk (Tsovinar Abikian-Mikayelian), with her Armenian character and dialect from Atabazar, is a real Armenian woman and mother concerned about her daughter, Azatuhi's future, because the latter was in love with a foreigner. However the father of the family was against their marriage.
The clashes brought them to the point when Margar who denied his nation faced the recovery of his poet son’s nationality.
The father by every means had tried to conceal his nationality from his poet son, who rejected the literary prize and five thousand sterling he deserved as a poet, because he preferred to take that prize as an Armenian and not as a foreign writer.
The disputes finally resolved when the Armenian offspring listened to the Crane Calling and left his family denying Armenian identity. He threw himself into the warm Armenian arms. "We lost him, but the Armenians won," says Father, responding to the regret of Mother.
Performance of Knar Dance Group (Lebanon)
Organized by the Dance Unit of the Regional Committee of Hamazkayin in Lebanon, the Knar Dance Troup of Hamazkayin performed Thursday, June 9, 2011, at 8:30 PM, at the Monnot Theater. A band of Armenian folk music instruments from Armenia also played during the performance.
Felix Harutyunyan is the dance instructor and the artistic director of Knar.
The band of Armenia folk music instruments was especially invited from Armenia for this occasion. The band members are: Hrach Nazaryan (conductor, doudoug, clarinet,) Ashot Vardanyan (soloist, Kamancha,) Gor Boulmoukhyan and Robert Dourents (dhol,) Artak Asatryan (doudoug, zourna,) Vigen Balasanyan (plool,) and Georg Movsesyan (accordion.)
The dance program started with the performance of the “Pert” (“Fortress”) dance, followed by a dance titled “Armenian girls.” Also performed were the dances “Mardagan,” “Noubar,” “Akhalkalak,” “Karavan,” to mention some.
Knar also danced the “Adagio,” and “Strangers in the night,” as well as Arabic, Moldovian and Georgian dances.
Ashot Vardanyan performed two songs.
All the performances were rewarded with applause from the audience.
The high performance quality as well as the presence of the folk band created a special atmosphere which was new and exciting for the Lebanese-Armenian audience.
In this sense, after the successful experience with the program “Yerk yerkots” of the Armenian National Television, this joint performance of Knar and the band from Armenia was the continuation of a new cooperation which is to be extendedto other spheres of art, as well.
Performance of Knar Dance Group of Hamazkayin (Lebanon)
With the high auspices of the Minister of Culture Gabi Layoun, the dance unit of Hamazkayin presented the Knar Dance Group’s annual performances. The performances kicked off Thursday, May 10, 2012 at 8:00 pm at the Sagesse Theater in Beirut.
A large audience attended the event which was dedicated to the memory of Felix Harurunyan, the late dance instructor of Hamazkayin.
Hovhannes Khachigian is the current dance instructor of the Knar Dance Group.
With the two parts of the program the dance group featured the best of Armenian folk dances.
The first part of the program had the theme of a traditional Armenian wedding, while in the second part the group performed a variety of dances, such as “Nino,” “Shalakho,” “Shirag,” “Sareri hovin mernen,” as well as an Arabic folk dance.
The Gayane Dance School of Hamazkayin took part in the program by performing three dances “Folk,” “Hayi acher,” and “Sartarabad.”
With this first show of this year Knar Dance Group of Hamazkayin gave the audience an opportunity to enjoy the art and high quality of Armenian dances and registered a new leap in the dance history of the Lebanese Armenian community.
Performance of the comedy Dinner for Schmucks (Canada)
The performance of the comedy Dinner for Schmucks by the Bedros Atamian Theater Group of the Hamazkayin Sanahin Chapter in Montreal took place on Saturday, November 3, 2012 at Theatre Beaubois in Montreal.
The famous play by Francis Veber was translated, arranged, and directed by Viken Tufenkjian.
Before reviewing the performance, I would like to highly praise the work done by the theater-loving members of the Armenian community in Montreal, especially the youth, who are gathered around Hamazkayin, as actors or assistants working behind the scenes, demonstrating their dedication to Armenian theater.
For more than two hours, the actors, some of whom are already well experienced, entertained the large audience with their lively and humorous performance.
Francis Veber, who is considered one of the most successful contemporary French playwrights, has adapted his play Dinner for Schmucks into a film.
The well-known film Le Dîner de Cons (“Dinner for Schmucks”) won a César Award in 1999.
The comedy presents how Pierre Labresh and his businessmen friends, unsatisfied with their personal lives, organize a weekly dinner, where everyone brings the dumbest guy he could find as a guest to ridicule and be amused.
The group member who succeeds in bringing the dumbest guest is selected as the winner.
One evening, when Pierre was getting ready to go to the dinner, the nice, yet naïve, guest he had chosen surprisingly twists the course of the evening. Eventually, certain truths, conspiracies, and betrayal stories are unfolded through a uniquely interesting and hilarious plot.
Levon Kaprielian (François Decard) is without doubt the chief performer of the play.
He fully brings to life the character of François, the good-hearted, yet simple-minded, dumb guest.
Kaprielian superbly presents each and every gesture, word, and expression.
Perhaps performing the role of the dumb guest is perceived as an easy task, however an excellent performance such as this one requires discipline, comprehension, and, of course, talent. And Kaprielian succeeded in playing his part in a brilliant and talented manner.
Razmig Tatoolian too shined on the stage with his engaging performance in the role of Pierre Labresh.
Throughout the performance, he had a dominant presence on the stage.
With his confident performance, as well as clear pronunciation, Tatoolian was highly acclaimed by the audience.
The performances of the following supporting actors were also praiseworthy: Zepure Boyajian (as Christine Labresh), Mesrob Berejikian (as Dr. Arshambo), Joel Der Nigoghossian (as Marlene Cousino), Saro Der Bedrossian (as Juste Leblanc), and Gary Zakarian (as Louis Gouin).
Tufenkjian, who has contributed greatly to the advancement of the Bedros Atamian Theater Group as an actor and director since 1971, succeeded in maintaining a dynamic pace throughout the whole show, where action and intrigue follow one another, grabbing the audience’s non-stop attention.
It is especially interesting how Tufenkjian has moved the plot from Paris to Montreal to make it more graspable for the audience. He has also included Québécois names and Canadian facts, such as the hockey rivalry between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens (the Habs).
There is no doubt that this performance is the result of months of dedicated work.
We are looking forward for the next performance.

Performance of “Garod” (Lebanon)
The Hamazkayin’s Art Schools have focused their activities of 2015 on the Centennial of the Armenian Genocide.
Director Robert Arakelian presented the performance "Garod" in the presence of a large crowd of students on Thursday, 12 March 2015, at 10: 00 am, and at 12: 00 pm, at "Der Melkonian" Theater Hall.
The Armenian director, the author and artistic director of the performance Robert Arakelian successfully managed to focus the young generation’s attention on the message delivered by the performance for about one hour.
That message is delivered through the character and life of the Diaspora Armenian that has survived the Armenian Genocide.
In other words, the author authentically reveals and gives the diagnosis of the weak, virulent, negative and spiritually exhaustive phenomenon, such as xenomania, assimilation risk, hopelessness and homeland dispossession, which any Diaspora Armenian faces in the role of an emigrant and in searches of "paradise" in the world.
"Garod is the Armenian of today and of all times, which wanders from country to country, trying to find a formula for happiness and justice. However, on the rocky crossroads of the multinational world, he concludes that the world will respect our cause only if we have a powerful county, and that we shall be able to gain righteousness only with healthy and dignified essence", rightfully states director Robert Arakelian.

Afterwards, with the dance “Cinderella,” the audience was taken into a world of fairy tales. It was followed by a dance of dolls, where the movements were sharp and finely tuned. Then it was the dance of the song “Barcelona,” during which the children danced with balls and football costumes.
With their delicate movements, the girls of Shushi presented the cross, the symbol of Christianity and made beautiful shapes on stage.
Then the shepherds’ dance came to remind us of the old days of agriculture.
The first part of the program concluded with a samba.
After the intermission, the young girls of Shushi performed a dance titled “Tsolk” (“Reflection,”) which was all about delicate hand movements.
It was followed by a very active Arabic folk dance, and then the program went on with several Armenian folk dances.
Following the graceful dance of the doves, event host Avo recited a poem, and the girls danced “Karabagh.”
All members of Shushi joined on the stage to dance the final dance together and were accompanied by the singing of Mrs. Soussanna, the troupe’s dance instructor.
Bishop Shahan Sarkissian, the Prelate of the Armenian Diocese in Aleppo attended the event on May 14. At the end of the event he took the stage and together with the chairperson of the chapter of Hamazkayin, presented a souvenir to Mrs. Soussanna. He also delivered his heartfelt words and concluded the event with his prayers.
The Prelate said that the event was an occasion of joy and victory.
He said: “This event is the power of the Armenians in Syria, who are also the true people of the Syrian fatherland. It is their expression of support to the strength of the country and it is with joy and excitement that we will continue our march.
Long live Armenia, long live Artsakh, long live Shushi, and long live Syria…”
After his words of blessing and appraisal, the Prelate concluded the evening with his prayers.

Organized by the Gomidas Chapter of Hamazkayin in Lebanon, the presentation of the book “Before and after the Genocide” by Dr. Zaven Mserlian took place on Friday, April 27, 2012 at 8:00 PM at the Nshan Palanjian Center of Hamazkayin.
On behalf of the Gomidas Chapter of Hamazkayin, Seta Khedeshian said Armenians living in Western Beirut are neglected by their own people and that this event is an opportunity to affirm that the Armenians of this region also share in demanding the rights of their people.
Kohar Kandaharian took the stage and presented the book, “Before and after the Genocide.”
She said the title itself is didactic and reveals the axis of the volume’s content, which in its turn highlights the author’s work in providing data and inventory for the preparations of the dossier of compensations.
Mrs. Kandaharian also said that in his research Dr. Mserlian relied on Turkish sources, too, with the purpose of highlighting the approach and the issues of Turkish history-writing related to the pre-Genocide period.
She drew attention to the fact that through his research the author affirms that the genocidal politics that aim at ultimately seizing Armenians’ fatherland continue today via the Turkish authorities.
After evaluating the book, Mrs. Kandaharain said that providing the new generation with information, comments, and analysis will support the continued demands and struggle of the Armenian people. She added that in this sphere the book “Before and after the Genocide” equips us with very important supply in our demands and struggles.
Afterward, Dr. Zaven Mserlian, featured the attempts of subsequent Turkish authorities in annihilating the Armenians throughout various periods.
He added that in the period of 1919-1923, the Turks massacred the remaining Armenians, and that very few are informed of this.
Dr. Mserlian added that during the internal deportations of 1929-1939, 130 children were killed and now who recalls the memory of these martyrs.
Dr. Mserlian also said the book features numbers, letters, documents, and pacts that reveal the truth about the history of the mentioned period.
He underlined that we should keep the issue of the Armenian cause alight as long as the Armenian people are demanding their rights.
Presentation of Anush Aknerian’s Book “Start” (Canada)
The presentation of Anush Aknerian's book "Start", organized by the Literary Committee of "Sanahin" Chapter of Hamazkayin Montreal and "Horizon" Weekly, took place on Thursday 31 March 2016, at 8: 00 pm, at "Avedis Aharonian" Hall of Montreal's Armenian Center.
We are pleased to inform that this first event was boradcasted live and had more than seventy followers.
The representative of the Literary Committee Anahit Balian delivered the opening speech and said that among our daily concerns, we have our national concerns related to the survival of our national identity and the people's carelessness towards the Armenian language both in homeland and the Diaspora.
She mentioned that the Armenian intellectuals, in different periods of our history, alerted people about those dangers, but we were recently shocked when the UNESCO declared the Western Armenian language as one of the "endangered languages".
Of course, some measures have been taken in that matter and still they are being taken to avoid this danger, but still we can reach solution of that problem if new poets, novelists and scholars will appear. They will attract the new generation towards our language and literature with their new creations and will rejuvenate our ancient language.
In this sense, Anush Aknerian's book is a successful example and the Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society believes that we badly need writers like Anush Aknerian, who are able to enrich our native language through their creations.
The book consists of a bunch of wonderful poems where the reader finds nicely expressed feelings and thoughts, love and outburst of emotions expressed in a pure style, simple and understandable language.
"Once I hear my name In the silence of your lips, Stars will gush from clouds Shrouding my tired face with light. "
After reciting this beautiful poem, Anahit Balian briefly presented the auther's biography.
Anush Aknerian is specialized in literature. She has finished a course of philosophy of language at MgKil University.
Besides poetry, she writes articles and translates them for literary magazines of the Diaspora and Armenia.
She is the publisher and Editor in Chief of the bilingual "Corridor Books" Publishing House.
Anush was the Executive Board Member of the Hamazkayin "Sanahin" Chapter, and then, for five years she successively was the Executive Board Secretary of Hamazkayin Canada.
She participated in the founding of the "Horizon" Magazine, working as an assistant editor, and now, she is one of the editors working for the "Horizon" Literary Supplement.
She has resettled in Montreal from Beirut and lives with her husband Vartkes Melkonian.
As the event was organized by both Hamazkayin and "Horizon" Weekly, the conductor invited Editor of "Horizon" Literary Supplement, Viken Abrahamian to make a speech. In his speech, Abrahamian remembered how 30 years ago, when he started to work for "Horizon", Anush Aknerian became a kind of a teacher for him.
After Comrade Abrahamian's speech, an old friend of Anush Aknerian, one of the prominent figures in the political and educational circles of the Armenian community in Canada, Armenian History teacher in St. Hagop Armenian School and finally a very dear person, Mher Karakashian came to the stage to present the book "Start".
Then, Anahit Balian invited the author Anush Aknerian to present a bouquet of her poems and to deliver her heartfelt speech.
The author spoke and expressed her feelings in an enchanting voice and attracted the attention of the audience towards her creations while presenting pictures related to each of her poem on the screen.
In her speech, Anush Aknerian thanked her parents that seeded in her the love and care towards the Armenian language and literature. She also thanked the organizers of the event and added, "... a writer should write either in his native language or in another.
Being a writer, he cannot fail doing it.
He should create wherever he is accepted.
If there is Armenian society, which cares for literature and encourages its writers financially and morally, then the Armenian literature will surely prosper and develop.
However, if there is no such society encouraging the artists and writers, then they will make another choice.
I cannot believe that there is any popular Armenian writer with good knowledge of language, which writes in a foreign language or contributes to the development of a foreign literature.
Having Armenian literature requires an Armenian reader.
Then, Anahit Balian made her concluding speech. She recited some lines from Aknerian’s poems.
"Where is the rumble of my voice that was called to move mountains?"
Balian turned to the author saying, "Dear Anush, with your voice and our joint efforts, we will certainly move mountains, and, we hope that it will give birth to a new generation of Armenian poets."
Anahit Balian expressed her respect and gratitude to Anush Aknerian in the name of the Executive Board of the Hamazkayin "Sanahin" Chapter for giving birth to such a wonderful book, to Mher Karakashian and to all those who believe in the importance of the Armenian language and literature, to the literary editorial staff of the "Horizon" Weekly and to Viken Aprahamian.
She also expressed gratitude to the book lover audience for their presence and interest towards the Armenian culture and for encouraging the Armenian literature and Armenian values.
At the end the guests enjoyed the reception, congratulated the author, which signed the books for them.

Later, the director thoroughly studied the painter’s art and concluded that in every phase of his life, the artist had expressed his feelings and emotions in a completely new style and with new colors, which "perfectly displayed the inner world of the artist orphaned in early childhood and the entire history of his fugitive people".
After Mutafian’s speech, the presentation of the one-hour film started. Each picture or portrait displayed in the film was accompanied by a relevant piece of music and Armen Mutafian’s corresponding description.
Zareh Mutafian was born at the coast of the Black Sea, in Samsun.
At his eight years of age, in 1915, he witnessed the massacre of his entire family.
He spent his childhood in orphanages and lived a wanderer’s life.
From Greece, he moved to Italy, where he studied art at Milan’s Academy of Fine Arts (Beaux-Arts) and upgraded his art skills.
Then he relocated to Switzerland and eventually settled in Paris, where soon he became a part of the intellectual circle of the time. There he dedicated himself to literature in parallel with painting.
He exposed his paintings at numerous of exhibitions, which were highly assessed by people of art.
Zareh Mutafian was a renowned Armenian intellectual and French artist for 40 years. He overcame his pain, studied the European culture, but also maintained his eastern spirit. He was a symbol of the Armenian Genocide.
In 1965, an exhibition was organized in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.
The works of the Italian classic artists, the wonderful French coloristes, the expressionists, and later Ponar and Mattis inspired the Armenian thinker artist.
Apart from Europe and later the United States, he exhibited his works in the Soviet Armenia (1967 and 1971).
Artist Mutafian, mainly drawing symbolic images, is famous also for his portraits, seascapes and colorful scenes.
The theme of the "survivors" always pursued him at various stages of his life, though he seldom touched upon the subject of Genocide, and had restraint attitude to it.
The film dedicated to Zareh Mutafian’s life and work contains documents and photographs researched by Professor Arto Pehlivanian.
It was really a significant presentation and a nice event dedicated to art.
The organizers of the event provided the audience with DVDs of the film.

Presentation of Gaya Guerian’s Book L’ARMENIENNE L’INDESTRUCTIBLE FIL DE LA VIE (The Armenian Woman: Indestructible Cord of Life) (Paris)
"Nor Haratch" – The presentation of Gaya Guerian’s book, published in October of 2015 by XO Publishing House (page 269), took place on Monday, June 20, 2016, at the Armenian Cultural Centre of Paris. The event was organized by the Hamazkayin Society.
"I was born in a Genocide survivor family, which had witnessed evil and bloody massacres. I was born in Armenia, but my dearest Homeland was the one, which had been ruined and lost.
In my childhood in Paris, it often seemed to me that I could hear the echoes of the slaughtered Armenian people from far away.
My grandmother Ashkhen with my mother Azat had been there, among the millions of beaten, sold, raped and deported women and strangled to death children condemned to death.
However, they miraculously survived.
Over the years, I wrote down and revived the story of their life," says the author.
She, describing the incredible story of her mother and grandmother, exposes the terrible cruelty of the Armenian Genocide, at the same time believing that despite the heavy burden of the past, one can cling to life.
Three years after her mother's death in 2004, she started writing the story of her mother and grandmother, as it had become a vital necessity for her, so that the tragedy of the genocide would never be erased from our memory.
The event was opened by Ms. Shirvanian. She told about the years spent together (with the author) at Armenian Dbrotsaser Women's School.
She presented a few episodes from the book.
"The story begins in the summer of 1915, in Trabzon, where the author's mother was born ... As is known, men had been executed and women with elderly people were exiled, and 300 children were strangled.
On the way to exile, her grandmother gave birth to a boy. The Turkish soldiers heard the boy’s first cry and forced her to bury the child alive ... her own child.
After this terrible incident, she managed to escape on foot and reached Constantinople.
There, the three-year-old girl was snatched from mother and was thrown into the children's caravan moving to the harbour.
A dozen ships were waiting for them".
"The soldiers put the children into the sacks, loaded them on ships, and then, they threw the sacks into the sea ... One of those soldiers recognized the author’s mother, as in the past, he had worked for their family. He decided to hide her.
Later, mother and daughter miraculously found each other".
The author learnt about the genocide-related events at Armenian Dbrotsaser Women's School, and, much later, she started to read and study the testimonies of survivors, and the tragic stories.
She found her parents’ old photos, showing their dwelling places, according to which she could draw the map of their tragic trip.
We can state that through this book and through the odyssey of her family, the author re-valuates the women and their struggle: "Despite all evil that many of these women went through, they never retreated and conveyed the command of " never to forget " to next generations."
Gaya Guerian loves the France of Jean Jaurès that accepted the exiled Armenians with open arms and gave them asylum. She hopes that her stories will give a little hope to all those who unfortunately have to leave their homesteads now and wander in the world as immigrants.
After the Q&A part, Guerian signed the volumes of her book.

The meeting took place on the evening of Wednesday, January 30, 2013 at the K. and H. Armenian Hall in the Hamazkayin Levon Shant Cultural Center, in Bourj Hammoud.
Nazareth Kevorkian, the secretary of “Pakin,” welcomed the guests and explained the purpose of this event. He then presented Maitre Nazareth Kevorkian’s biography and works, shedding light on his career as a lawyer and on his literary works and published books.
Kevorkian said: “As a lawyer, Maitre Shamlian has been a member of the Bar Associations in Beirut and Quebec. From 1960 to 1964, he was a member of the Lebanese Parliament.
He was also a member of the Central Committee of Hamazkayin when Simon Vratsian was its chairman.
He taught ancient Armenian law at the Institute of Armenian Studies of Hamazkayin in Beirut.
From 1952–1982, he was the lawyer and legal consultant of the Armenian Prelacy in Lebanon and all its affiliated councils, assemblies, schools, and compatriotic unions.
He was the practicing lawyer of the Armenian Relief Cross of Lebanon, Hamazkayin, Homenetmen–Armenian General Athletic Union, and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Tashnagtsoutioun), handling their affairs with state and judicial authorities.”
Afterwards, Maitre Puzant Bastajian, the event’s guest speaker, took the stage.
He presented a brief overview of the book by reading excerpts.
He first talked about the translations, explaining that Maitre Shamlian has translated works by various foreign authors.
Then, Bastajian talked about the writings on legal topics, noting that in his book Maitre Shamlian has selected and used one-word terms that convey the complete meaning of legal matters.
The guest speaker then presented Maitre Shamlian’s writings on national and religious topics, such as “Simon Vratsian and the Establishment of Hamazkayin,” “Catholicosate of Cilicia and its Possible Discontinuation,” and “The Issue of Comic Illustrations of Prophet Mohammed.”
Talking about the latter, Maitre Bastajian said that the author has underlined the limits of freedom of speech and expression, and has raised relevant questions.
Talking about the history section, Maitre Bastajian focused on three major topics: royal letters, slaves of ancient Armenia, and pre-Mashtots Armenian literature.
First, the guest speaker explained how in his book Maitre Shamlian presents evidence for the existence of Armenian letters and literature before the Christianization of Armenia, and for the disappearance of that literary heritage as a result of Christianization.
Talking about the royal letters, Maitre Bastajian said that they contain listings and directories of Armenian noble families.
There are also army letters, which include information on Armenian regiments.
The author has categorized these data in his book and, after studying the royal letters, has concluded that the Armenian army had started weakening in the 7th century, especially because of the bdeshkhs (rulers of Armenian border regions).
Finally, Maitre Bastajian talked about the slaves of ancient Armenia.
According to Maitre Shamlian’s book, the practices of slavery and slave trade existed in ancient Armenia and in Cilicia.
He has presented four types of slaves, who could also be women: housemaids, royal servants, temple slaves, and church slaves.
The author has included quotes from the lawbook of Mkhitar Kosh, which makes reference to the royal slaves and how widespread were the practices of selling or offering them to others as gifts.
The rights of these slaves varied according to their religion: a Christian slave enjoyed more rights than other slaves.
A Q & A session took place toward the end of the event.

According to Mr. Toranian, this new novel expresses the agony of the Diasporan Armenian.
Levon Arissian, the main character, is living in spiritual solitude, and all his dreams crash on American pavement.
Toranian also praised the charm of Balian’s writing style, and called this novel a success.
At the request of the audience, Deacon Harout Shernezian spoke about immigration, the main theme of Balian’s novel, and the dream of a pink America, which is not new to the Armenian reality, but is growing.
According to Deacon Shernezian, in the 208-page novel, the main character has fallen to his knees under the burden of his dreams. In his elegant and smooth language, Balian warns the Armenian youth of the dangers of assimilation.
Deacon Shernezian summed up his review in three main points: first, the immense America with all his goodness and appearances of hospitality does not correspond to the Armenian reality.
It robs the identity of the Armenian individual.
The latter remains an Armenian only in name.
Second, the cry for Armenian identity is very strong in the inner world of the main character.
Even in foreign lands pne looks for an Armenian church.
Atop his fragile hopes he attempts to build a dream.
Third, the emptiness in the last period of the main character’s life prevails like black smoke.
The book cover, designed by Lebanese Armenian artist Ara Azad, enhances the novel’s content.
The novel was further discussed and its main character was perceived in a negative image, as someone who had lost his battle.

Pride-Filled Armenian Youth Celebrate Sayat-Nova
One of longstanding hopes of the Hamazkayin Western U.S. Regional Executive Board’s Literary Committee has been to integrate young people into the literary-cultural community.
The youth committee formed for this purpose had its first meeting on January 22, 2019, where they named themselves Hamazkayini Hpart Hyeortiner, agreeing that, “the goal of Hpart Hyeortiner is to assist Hamazkayin in maintaining, developing, and spreading the Armenian identity with the mission to further the existence of Armenia and the legacy of its rich 6000 years of history, culture, and language. To these ends, Hpart Hyeortiner is committed to engaging and advancing the Armenian youth through literary, artistic, musical, cultural, and educational initiatives.”
The committee works with determination to ensure that future generations appreciate Armenian culture and come to know it well, but also to put their own unique stamp on it, contributing to the further development of Armenian culture.
The committee enthusiastically engaged in cultural activity, and held its first event on December 13, 2019, in Hamazkayin’s hall in Glendale, California.
At the event, college students, parents, and other guests present heard Allen Dichgrikian speak about the Paulician (flourished between 650 and 872) and Tondrakian (early 9th century to 11th century) movements. Vazgen Barseghian spoke about Hamshen and its musical instruments and cultural life, singing a few songs.
Hamazkayini Hpart Hyeortiner’s second event took place on March 19, 2019, and was primarily a celebration of Antranig Dzarugian’s Letter to Yerevan, with performances of English translations lighting up the room.
The evening also featured Natali Halachian, Martin Atamian, Varant Anmahuni, Allen Dichgrikian Allen Dichgrikian, and Vazgen Vanetsi Barseghian displaying their talents through recitation, song, and performance art.
Judging by the crowd’s overwhelmingly positive reaction, it is certain that everything these young people are doing should be applauded.
The committee’s next event took place on May 31, 2019, and was “An Evening of Sayat Nova.”
The committee members’ talents were the key to the evening’s success.
They made it possible to present the music of the king of late medieval Armenian troubadours, Sayat Nova.
The committee aimed to keep alive the place and role of his inimitable talent in the minds of diaspora Armenian youth, some of whom, probably, have not heard his songs.
In addition to the music, the committee hoped to bring out Sayat Nova’s legendary life story.
Even before the opening speech, Martin Adamian recited some lines of poetry.
The opening speech was delivered by Varant Anmahuni, who also interpreted certain poems as the program progressed.
One important part of the event was the presentation of some of Sayat Nova’s musical works by Vladimir Grigorian, an expert on the troubadour.
On the kamancha, he gave invaluable breath and spirit to Sayat Nova’s work, evoking his glory and charisma, as befits the great man.
Grigorian’s student and committee member Vazgen Barsegian joined his teacher on the kamancha and saz, performing several pieces.
Aside from the instrumental and vocal performances, there were slide presentations dedicated to the life, work, and legacy of Sayat Nova.
The first was by Mr. Barsegian and Natalie Halachian; the second by Edig Alavertian.
Poetry readings were by Martin Atamian, Nayiri Partamian, and Natalie Halachian.
Ms. Partamian and Ms. Halachian also danced an arrangement of Badgirkt Ghalamov Kashadz, as recorded by Levon Katerjian.
Hamazkayin Literary Committee member Raffi Melkonian spoke, noting that he regarded the spirit and hardworking attitudes of the young committee members with the utmost pride and admiration.
Melkonian also made a point of introducing Hamazkayin Central Executive Board member Dr. Dikran Babikian, Regional Executive Board Chairperson Knar Kortoshian, and board members Vania Babigian and Arpi Hamparian.
He also announced to those present that the Literary Committee is recruiting new members, and encouraged them to join the committee or Hamazkayini Hpart Hyeortiner
To conclude the evening, the committee recited together a piece by Hovhannes Tumanian about Sayat Nova.
At the end of the event, guests were offered a food tasting and Sayat Nova brandy.
Throughout the night, the guests had been sold raffle tickets. The winners received valuable gifts relating to Sayat Nova.

Principal of M. & H. Arslanian Djemaran
The Lebanese Armenian Community is one of the few communities of the Diaspora, which understand the importance of giving strong patriotic education to the new generation using the favorable conditions in the countries of their residence.
It is one of those communities that despite the difficult life conditions of recent decades, staunchly make large investments to maintain, upgrade and develop the network of Armenian daily schools, which means not only modernization and development of structures, but also upgrade of human resources.
Indeed, the newly built National United College will open its doors next year, and the new Hamazkayin nursery is now being built in the territory of Arslanian Djemaran.
This renovation coincides also with natural substitutions in the staff.
At the end of the last school year, the Lebanese Armenian Community entrusted the management of two daily schools to the young candidates specialized in the sphere of education.
They will certainly apply modern approaches, will breathe life into those schools and improve them.
One of those two schools is the National United College, about which the National Authorities have already distributed a special press release.
By this Press Release we inform the Armenian people of the Diaspora and Homeland and especially the Armenian Community of Lebanon about the very important step taken by Melankton & Haig Arslanian Djemaran.
During the 2015-2016 school year graduation ceremony, when the current principal, Dikran Jinbashian announced about his retirement after his long-term tireless service, Paola Yeghiayan was appointed principal of Arslanian Djemaran according to the decision made by the Central Executive Board of Hamazkayin.
Paola Yeghiayian got her education in Djemaran and worked there as a teacher for 20 years. Due to her teaching experience and professional capacities and also her faithfulness towards the objectives, atmosphere and spirit of Djemaran, Paola Yeghiayian will certainly accomplish those goals, mixing the traditions with modern methods and practices.
Paola Yeghiayian has specialized in the education branch of University. Now she is completing her doctoral studies and will bring high level professionalism and professional approaches to Djemaran.
Paola Yeghiayan is young, full of abilities and capacities, due to which she will be able to lead Djemaran to new successes, development and modernization.

The topic of the lecture was "Armenian Caesarea and the Armenian Communities in Asia Minor."
Houry Baghdasaryan made an opening speech on behalf of the Board, represented the keynote speaker and gave floor to him.
The lecture was focused on the Armenian communities located out of Historic Armenia, which had taken roots over the centuries and had organized life, schools and churches, such as Caesarea, Yozgat, Kutahya, Izmit, Adapazar, Izmir and many others.
"We had significant colonies everywhere, not only on the Armenian lands, in 6 vilayets, but everywhere. All of them were developed, had wealthy merchants and artisans, which were part of the cream of the rural or town society.
Even if there were 4-5 hundred Armenians in a city having 10 million population, they necessarily had their own schools and churches and were considered the developed and progressive part of the population. It is a fantastic fact," said the lecturer in his speech.
The lecture was followed by the photo and film screening, treating and book signing.

Prof. Thovmas Poghosian Delivered a Lecture on “Armenian Ashugh Art” (Lebanon)
An interesting lecture on "Armenian Ashugh Art", organized by the Regional Executive Board of Hamazkayin Lebanon, took place on Thursday 3 March 2016, at 7: 00 pm, at "Gevorg and Hermine Armenian" Hall of Hamazkayin "Levon Shant" Center. The lecturer was the artistic director of "Sayat Nova "Ensemble, Prof. Thovmas Poghosian.
Speaking about the Ashugh Art, Prof. Poghosian stated that it is the richest treasury of the Armenian culture, but unfortunately, the specialists have not studied it properly so far.
Trying to explain the distinctions between the Ashugh, Gusan and Folk arts, the lecturer said that the first two are similar as song- writing arts. Gusan music and songs appeared in pagan era. Its 3000 years old song-repertoire includes epic songs from the Armenian mythology, such as "Birth of Vahagn".
Gusan music and songs are written in free style. No rhyme or verse exists in them.
While in Ashugh songs, the rhyme and verse always exist.

The work will last for about two years.
Mutafyan's lecture was so interesting that it entailed a lot of questions.

Reading of “Road to Armenian survival” (Lebanon)
“Pakin” Literary Magazine hosted a reading of the book “Road to Armenian survival” by Hrair Jebejian on Wednesday, October 12, 2011, at 7:00 PM, at the editorial offices of “Pakin.”
Seta Krikorian spoke about the book and its value. She highlighted the fact that all the short stories featured in “Road to Armenian survival” express three factors that form the essence and character of Hrair Jebejian: Armenian identity, Lebanese identity, and evangelism. All his stories revolve around these themes.
Referring to memorable quotes, topics and characters, she presented a general view of the book.
Toward the end of her speech, Seta Krikorian put an emphasis on Jebejian’s own struggle for survival: “Surviving as an Armenian at any corner of the world, surviving as a citizen of a country, for the equal upholding and development of two identities of Diasporan generations, but also surviving for the preservation of Christian values and the establishment of justice, thus raising a just cry for the human, territorial, and cultural compensation directed towards the genocidal Turk.”
Concluding her words, Seta Krikorian said that in Hrair Jebejian’s writings one should seek for the triangle that completes the nature of the Armenian, the Lebanese, and the Christian, as well as the Jebejian way of the Armenian struggle.
Afterwards, Hrair Jebejian emphasized the importance of a holistic culture, in which the national culture and the Christian faith are inseparable and complete each other.
It is with this approach that thoughts, recollections, feelings, and messages are voiced in his book.
Mr. Jebejian also talked about the Armenian Genocide and its claims on Armenian blood.
He says that he constantly tries to transmit this legacy and mission to his children, and through this book, to the public.
The event was concluded by readings of excerpts from “Road to Armenian survival.”
Recitation Contest (Canada)
As it is known to all, the Literary Committee of Hamazkayin Gladzor Chapter has always tried to organize various literary performances and forums for Toronto’s Armenian Community.
The purpose of these activities is to get the Community’s young generation interested in the Armenian literature.
It becomes possible when you give an opportunity to the young people, and even the little ones, to be acquainted with the rich Armenian literature and become involved with it.
From this standpoint, the Literary Committee organized a recitation contest for all Armenian students living in Ontario.

SONG OF ARMENIA Performed (Canada)
The Montreal Armenian Community had been looking forward to the arrival of the RA People's Artist, Ashot Ghazaryan, Yerevan Chamber Theater’s actor, Rafael Yeranosyan, and actor of the Fullhouse project, Arpi Gabrielian.
Finally the famous artists arrived, and the Sanahin Chapter of Hamazkayin Monreal organized their performance at the main Hall of Lavallee Centre Armenie, on January 27, 2018.
It was surprising that at least one hour before the performance the lobby was already packed with about 600 fans, which had come to watch the Armenian artists’ performance, and it was really encouraging. Probably nostalgia for Homeland had also brought them there, as the evening was called Song of Armenia.
The heroes of the day performed a comic show through songs, speeches, and sometimes dances.
Children and adults were attentively following their every word. Sometimes it was so funny that it was impossible not to laugh.
The actors skilfully sang the songs of well-known singers imitating them and improvising, thus creating a pleasant atmosphere.
The famous actor and singer Ashot Ghazarian also performed several Armenian folk songs, and at lightning speed told dozens of anecdotes, most of which had a figurative sense.
The joyful atmosphere continued until late at night, after which some of the attendees took memorable notes or pictures with the native actors.
The performance Song of Armenia really made our day, and we hope that similar events may happen in the future as well.

Statement of the Ninth Hamazkayin Convention
The delegates gathered from various countries for the Ninth Convention of the Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society are concerned about the very serious threats facing Armenia and Artsakh.
The current administration's anational policy, the retreat from spiritual and cultural values, the schism in the nation, the flaming of sectarian divisions, and the abandonment of national strategic goals caused the catastrophe that Armenia and Artsakh now face.
We stand at the threshold of the loss of Artsakh's independence and Armenia's self-rule.
As an all-Armenian educational and cultural organization, we express our deep concern about the ongoing deliberate erasure of the Armenian material heritage in Artsakh.
The Convention denounces the genocidal policy of the Azerbaijani state toward Armenian spiritual and cultural values and its expansionist policy toward Armenia and Artsakh.
For representatives of numerous Armenian communities, where generation after generation have struggled to maintain their national identity, the position of Armenia's current administration is intolerable.
Only through the consolidation of our national forces can we overcome the current catastrophic situation.

Story Hour for Kids Committee
Story Time for Children (Canada)
The habit of narration has come from ancient times. Long before the writing and literature, the generations, through oral stories, passed their knowledge to next generations, thus educating them.
The narrators were teachers, advisers, entertainers, mentors, moral teachers, healers, and hope givers.
In our reality, a striking example of such narration is the epic poem Sassountsi David, which has been transmitted orally in the form of folk poems for ages until 1873, when Garegin Srvandztiants finally put it in written form, summing them up in four separate acts: Sanasar Baghdasar, the Great Mher (also known as Lion Mher), David of Sassoun and Little Mher.
In 2017, the Literary Committee of Hamazkayin Gladzor Chapter started the program Story Time for Children. On December 18, the fourth gathering took place at the renovated and redecorated hall of the Hamazkayin Harutyun Manoogian Library.
The narrator was Dr. Ani Hasserjian, and the topic was New Year celebration.
The program also included manual work coordinated by the Literary Committee members, Arda Der Hagopian and Armine Torikian.
Dr. Ani Hasserjian, in her special, exquisite style, told the story of Christmas and New Year. The little ones listened to the story with great interest and did their manual work with great enthusiasm.
It is doubtless that the Story Time is useful for both narrators and listeners. The program generally develops imagination, teaches moral, arouses interest in reading, teaches the kids to listen and to be patient.
However, Hamazkayin's Story Time program pursues two main goals: first, it gives the little ones an opportunity to listen to the Armenian speech, and to express their thoughts in Armenian. Second, it brings together children from different schools (Armenian and foreign) and creates a pleasant social atmosphere for them providing an opportunity to know each other, to create social connections and make friends in an intimate atmosphere.
The Story Time for children, contiguous to the book lovers’ forums, has made a good start and is aimed at becoming a program on a monthly basis. This program is a modest contribution to the Hamazkayin educational and cultural program.
We rely on the parents' encouragement.

Talented Kids of Hamazkayin “Arev” Dance Group Charm the Audience (USA)
The "Levon Shant" Chapter of North San Fernando Valley is the youngest member of Hamazkayin family.
Founded only 10 years ago, it soon became famous and renowned within the whole region thanks to the Board members’ efforts, dedication, and various public events.
Thus, along with many other cultural programs and activities, the Board brought to life a very nice idea founding a children's dance group and entrusted it to a well-known dance instructor Shushan Avagyan.
On the other hand, however, bringing together talented young musicians (violinists, pianists, etc.), the Board continued to be closely engaged with the project, encouraged and praised the children, their talent and work.

The Secretary of the Regional Committee Anita Havatian delivered the opening speech presenting the great artist and appreciating him for his art on behalf of Hamazkayin. She highly assessed the presentation of the foreign culture along with the Armenian culture, which is especially important for the worldwide multi-layered Armenians subject to cultural interactions in the places of their residences without compromising the national cultural legacy.
In this sense, we should highly assess Guy Manoukian’s talent, his own compositions and the unique performances of the re-arranged musical pieces. Thanks to Guy’s communicativeness and frankness, his performances not only captivate the audience, but also link them with the stage.
His musical works are of equally great value with the musical interpretations combined with short and concise narratives. Guy’s music makes the audience imaginably go back to the past, to the childhood memories, and a very small piece of song performed by him, revives imperishable reminiscences in the spiritual world of his audience.

Talin Der Minassian Book Launch in Paris
February 4th 2019 saw a Paris celebration for Talin Der Minasian’s 2018 books, Les Galaxies Markarian, and Norilsk: l’architecture au Goulag. Ms. Ter Minassian attended the event.
The event was opened by Arpi Shirvanian, who explained that Ter Minassian is a historian, researcher at CNRS, lecturer at INALCO, as well as a specialist in the history of Transcaucasia and the Soviet Union, in addition to providing summaries of her books, which she described as being fruits of years of archival research.
After summarizing the books, Shirvanian asked their author to speak.
Ter Minassian began by speaking of Norilsk, which is the far north’s coldest city, as well as the most polluted nickel-mining region of Russia.
The book tells a story of Soviet architects Gevorg Kochar and Mikayel Mazmanian, who were oppressed and exiled, and their amazing journey.
Their mission was to transform Noril’lag, a camp with 1930s architecture, into a city, to allow their place of exile to be liveable.
Norilsk’s architecture is essentially a copy of Yerevan’s.
The second book, Les Galaxies Markarian, is a geopolitical novel that melds reality and imagination together, where facts are used to reflect on past and present issues.
In the northeastern foothills of Mount Aragsts, the medieval fortress at Amberd becomes the site of an incident.
As Ter Minassian explains, the theme is Zoroastrianism, the dominant religion of Iran and the Near East before the spread of Islam.
The travels of Zoroastrians allow the author to explore the peoples of the region and their complex political issues.

Later, in 1970-2000, Armenian immigrants from Lebanon, Iran and Armenia joined them, and the community numbered up to 5,000.
Gathering around the Armenian Apostolic church founded in 1975, this community founded the Tarkmanchats College in 1996 due to the Zadik Aslanian’s tireless efforts and the support of the local municipality.
Tarkmanchats College certified its agreement with the French government in 2005.
The three-story building of the College situated on the territory of 3,000 square meters, has 15 classrooms, auditorium and inner and outer courtyards.
The school observes all the security rules established by the state and is able to receive 400 students.
Currently, the school has 80 pupils attending kindergarten and elementary school categories.
It is planned to start the secondary department in the nearest future.
The educational program of the Tarkmanchats College consists of French and English programs defined by the state and accomplished with the Armenian language and history classes.
The elementary school graduation success is 100 percent, while the average of the scores is 80 percent.
Thus, the College gives the children of the Armenian community in Issy-le-Moulineaux and the surrounding quarters an opportunity to get both French and Armenian education, enrich their education with both cultures, which form the future citizens.
The Tarkmanchats College having strengthened in the heart of the Armenian community joined the Hamazkayin educational institutions’ program with its twenty years of experience. Now it will enjoy the fruitful result of the Society’s activities, be it the teachers’ training, developed educational programs, the rich experience of Jemarans in Beirut, Marseille and Sydney, through either the Hamazkayin’s pan-Diaspora or homeland network, or international sponsorship programs.

The play portrayed the breakdown of a marriage and the fate of a woman in a society dominated by men, with expectations set by men.

We often see announcements in Nor Hay Horizon or online about the initiatives of the Booklovers’ Group in Toronto.
For the last ten years, this Hamazkayin group has been presenting the jewels of our literature to the Toronto Armenian community.
These events are alive in our memory; excerpts from biographies, research studies, poems, correspondence, and other writings are presented to the audience with care and attention to detail.
Each time, the screen holds photographs of the authors, of their manuscripts, and the schools they attended. Sometimes we hear the voices of the authors on speakers.
The Booklovers’ Group of the Hamazkayin Toronto Chapter’s Literary Committee has deliberately selected young people to be part of its programs.
The young people are given support and direction, including primary sources and opportunities to practice their presentations.
Beyond these literary events, the group organizes gatherings to allow young people to explore literature in Armenian. In short, the group has built a bridge between Armenian youth and Armenian literature.
We are so grateful to the backbone of this group, Tamar Donabedian Kuzuian, who brought about, coordinated, and pursued this program, having with her at all times teachers Moushegh Karakashian and Hasmig Babian; Hamazkayin comrades Armineh Toriguian and Arda Der Hagopian Elejian, Aren Mnatsaganian, Varak Babian, and Rupen Janbazian.

Seeing the results of their virtuosity, we forget that they are volunteers.
Long live our comrades who spare no effort to share their love of and faith in Armenian literature with Toronto Armenians.”)

The Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Association, in honor of its 90th anniversary, donated 27 valuable manuscripts from the 14th and 20th centuries (Ritual Books, Collections, Yasmavurk/Saints’ Behavior, Psalms, Gospel, etc.) to the Matenadaran on May 17, 2018, at the Mesrop Mashtots Matenadaran’s Hall.
Historian Yervand Pampukian has compiled the manuscripts, made the listings of books, and has provided the necessary information.
Matenadaran’s Director Vahan Der Ghevondian delivered the opening speech emphasizing the importance of handing such valuable manuscripts to the preservation of the Matenadaran, noting that the Matenadaran had not ever received donations of such valuable manuscripts during the last 15 years.
Vahan Der Ghevondian noticed that the repatriation of these values was a significant event, and expressed gratitude to the Central Executive Board of Hamazkayin for this precious gift.
Central Executive Board Member, Viken Tufenkjian made a speech on behalf of the Board saying that those six-hundred-year old 27 valuable manuscripts from different sources of Armenian thought and faith, kept under the care of Hamazkayin , form one of the most important collections of our national heritage.
Touching upon the essence of Hamazkayin, he confirms that the Association is not a sponsoring or restoring to life structure, but has a mission to preserve the national values and culture and to convey them to new generations.
"At the same time, the Hamazkayin Association strives to provide innovative ways for exposing the spirit of the same national values, and to open new creative platforms. It believes that these paths will provide the survival of our national age-old treasures," he said.
Viken Tufenkjian spoke about the Matenadaran as an important place for keeping and exhibiting the manuscripts.
"Matenadaran is one of the best manifestations of our intellectual potential. Moreover, it is the place where the Armenian national treasury is preserved and researched to find the wisdom and philosophy of our nation inherited from our collective past."
At the end of his speech, Vicken Tufenkian underlined the rapid growth of technology and communication in today's life, and refered to the unbroken dedication of those twenty-seven manuscripts’ creators, their belief in their work, by which they ensured the survival of the constituent elements of Armenian identity from generation to generation and from centuries to centuries.
"In our materialistic world, where the outward appearance has become a guarantee for success, the inspiration and faith that stimulated the authors of these manuscripts become even more noticeable and prominent, if we want to bridge our past to our present, to make our history a daily companion for us, to be guided by them and to ensure the eternity of our national identity and our enduring future," he concluded.
Chief Depositary of Matenadaran, Doctor of Historical Sciences, Kevork Der Vartanian, gave general and complete information to the participants about the collection of manuscripts.
Director of the Matenadaran, Vahan Der Ghevondyan, presented a Thank-You Note with a luxurious silver plated copy of Grigor Naregatsi's "Matyan Voghbergutyan" written in Cilicia in 1173 to the Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Association
The children’s choir of Hamazkayin, a promising phenomenon (Canada)
For many it is a moment of reliving sweet childhood memories. For others, it is a singular opportunity to take pride in their children or grandchildren.
Yet beyond and above all this the yearly concert of the Children’s Choir of Hamazkayin is one of the best events that fill the souls of its audience with hope and joy and a perfect example of Armenian national education.
It is June 26, 2011. The place is the Hamazkayin Theater of the Toronto Armenian Youth Center.
The stage is in a music school: glittering notes, colorful flowers and a violin sit amid school objects.
The host of the event is Arsho Arabatian, the vice-chairperson of the current committee of the Klatsor Chapter of Hamazkayin.
On behalf of the committee, she thanks the parents for their sacrifice and their belief in the choir, as well as the committee members for their devoted work. She also thanked Hripsimeh Demirjian, the professional choir conductor for her careful and tireless work.
Afterwards, the hostess invited the audience to enjoy a bouquet of songs from the rich treasury of the Armenian songs.
The program was rich and varied.
The choir conductor entered the stage followed by 15 children aged 4-11 wearing purple costumes and who sweetly smiled at the audience.
The program commenced with the “Children’s prayer,” which was excellently performed. It was followed by “Let’s sing in Armenian,” with its daring and convincing performance.
Melania Shamahian, Garen Demirjian, and Elizabeth Kandaharian performed the song “There is a sun and a moon,” and together with the choir they do their part with no mistakes. And then it was time for the mothers’ song.
The choir performed “Mairig jan” (“Dear Mairig.”) Anoush Haroutunian performed “Mairign aisor oushatsel e” (“Mom is late today”) and enchants the audience with her sweet voice.
The songs “Yegek yerkenk” (“Let’s sing,”) “Yerk Massisi” (“Song of Massis,”) “Giligia,” “Mshetsi mor yerke” (“The song of a Mother from Moush,”) and “Artiok ovker en” (“Who might they be”) were performed one after the other.
Violinist Sona Kaltagian read an introduction prior to the performance of each song. 
The next song was “Kedashen,” performed by Mineh Dzadourian and Haig Haroutiounian, who sang it with deep emotion.
A story that deeply moved the audience was told after the song was performed. Kousan Haikazoun, the author of “Kedashen” and other songs told the audience that back in 1992, during the deportations of Shahoumian, Armenian troop had positioned themselves in the forests of Shahoumian and Mardagerd to secure a safe deportation.
The soldiers were informed that children’s voices are heard from the forests, yet no one replied to the calls of the soldiers.
Then the commander ordered his troops to sing “Kedashen.”
Only then an 80-year-old man with a rifle appeared, followed by 43 orphans. This is a story that gives further meaning to the song “Kedashen.”
Afterwards, Vani Yakoubian performed “Hover, hover” (“Winds, o winds,”) and with her confidence she enchants the audience. The sweet performance of “Aghchga yerke” (“The girl’s song”) by Lissa Sarkissian is followed afterwards.
The folk song “Halel em” (“I’ve melted”) was clearly and confidently performed by Erica Koutian.
The program was concluded with “Groong” by Kevork Emin, and was remarkably performed by the choir.
All the songs were performed superbly both by the choir and the soloists, thus receiving warm applause from the audience.
Toward the end of the project, conductor Hripsimeh Demirjian, who was also accompanying the choir on the piano, thanked Hamazkayin, the parents, and her family for their sacrifice.
This initiative of the Klatsor chapter of Hamazkayin is very much appreciated. The professionalism and the dedication of conductor Hripsimeh Demirjian was obvious. The children and their parents also deserve appreciation and merits.

The First Press Used by Hamazkayin Publishing Founder Nigol Aghpalian on Display in Lebanon
On December 10, 2018, at Hamazkayin’s Lucy Tutunjian Gallery, the original printing press used by Nigol Aghpalian, founder of Hamazkayin publishing, was put on display. Also on display were the publications released by the Hamazkayin Vahe Setian Publishing House in 2017 and 2018. The event was dedicated to the centennial of the Armenian republic and the 90th anniversary of Hamazkayin.
Hagop Havatian, director of the publishing house, spoke.
The Western Armenian and diaspora Armenian literary field would have been much poorer had Hamazkayin and one of its founders, Nigol Aghpalian, not had the vision to establish a publishing mission.
Many thousands of books—books for children and teenagers, literary books, books on art, history, and the Armenian cause, scholarly tomes and coffee-table books—and hundreds of textbooks have enriched the field over 87 years.
They have left an indelible mark on our lives. Generation after generation enjoys the fruits of that field.
Mr. Havatian said that publishing has been difficult from the very start. Aghpalian, for some time, had to dip into his personal resources to continue and maintain the work.
He succeeded in etching that spirit and emphasis on Hamazkayin’s general mission.
Thanks to his willpower and decisiveness, the work continues to this day.

Their singing reflected the real image of Syria, and, as the Festival's artistic director, Maestro Missak Baghboudarian said the chorus was a result of a collective work, and the joint singing of the choirs presenting various cities and colors of Syria reflected the coexistence of different cultures existing in Syria.

Each group had chosen a sentence, which was rhythmically sung first separately, then all the groups sang together the chosen rhythmic sentences, creating beautiful, and at the same time a vibrant harmony.
This was a new style in choral singing and gave the participating choirs the opportunity to work together.
Then, the choirs together sang two patriotic songs and dedicated them to their Syrian Homeland.
At the end, each chorus was granted a certificate of honor by the organizing body.
Choirmaster Gayane Simonian-Derian received the certificate of honor granted to Hamazkayin Syria Regional Executive Board and presented a silver shield as a gift to the Damascus Culture and Art House on behalf of the Regional Executive Board.
Besides its artistic value, the concert was a kind of message to all parties inciting the Syrian crisis and trying to pervert its image.
That message said that Syria was a country of coexisting cultures and mutual tolerance. It will continue to preserve that image by such high quality encouraging performances as well.

Misak Terzian exhibits three works from different collections, "Odalisque", "Trio Champetre" and "Le Temps des Mimosas".
"Odalisque" is a part of Terzian’s semi-abstract collection, which has brought him fame.
"Trio Champetre" pertains to music, and "Le Temps des Mimosas" pertains to motherhood.
According to Terzian, not the inspiration but the innovation is the most important in the creative process. It should even surprise the artist at the end, and be the guarantee of success.
As Terzian says, he can sometimes return to any painting after many years and work on it again, but from a different aspect.
The way Terzian uses the brush and combines the colors give birth to modern creations. For example, "Trio Champetre" is a work where we do not see the three musicians, but we can have a glimpse of them in the harmonious combination of colors.

The Novel “Rouge Offrande” is Launched in Paris
On November 7, 2022, at the Paris House of Armenian Culture, Hamazkayin held a book launch for Rouge Offrande, the French translation of Arpiar Arpiarian’s novel, Garmir Zhamuts (Red offering).
The evening was dedicated to Arpiarian through the novel, which has been the focus of research by Jean-Pierre Kibarian.
Ara Krikorian spoke about Arpiarian’s specific realist style, his work with various newspapers in Constantinople and Tiflis, and his personal vigor. He noted that Arpiarian had approached and joined the Hunchakian Party and was assassinated in Cairo in 1908.
The topic of the day was not the author, however. The topic was the protagonist of Rouge Offrande, Father Housig. Having recently settled in Constantinople from his distant Armenia, from his village Domuz, he sang loudly and performed rituals in Ortukiugh Church. This was something the local amira found unnecessary and even dangerous.
Father Housig’s singing tone was more of a call to rebellion than it was a prayer.
The novel Rouge Offrande in its entirety was Father Housig’s testimony.
The novel let us come to know Father Housig who was called, in disparagement, Gharib Derder, “Migrant Padre.”
But in parallel Kibarian’s research introduced us to Vramchabouh Kibarian, who came to Paris in 1899 and became the first prelate of the Armenian cathedral in Paris.
What was the connection between the Migrant Padre of Rouge Offrande, arriving in Ortukiugh from faraway Domuz and occupying everyone’s attention with his peasant appearance and faith in freedom and the founder of the Paris Armenian cathedral, Archbishop Vramchabouh Kibarian d'Artchouguentz?
Rouge Offrande is not simply a rendition of Garmir Zhamuts in French.
The book contains a second part, written by Jean-Pierre Kibarian, that explains how this simple priest, having lost his wife, leaving some of his five children behind, had arrived in Paris and became the first archbishop of the Armenian community here.
The parallel to the novel’s protagonist does not end here. When Jean-Pierre Kibarian presented the Migrant Padre, he was presenting his grandfather.
Drawing on the archbishop’s letters and personal writings, he brought Father Housig to life and confirmed the archbishop’s path.
Through his work, the grandson has not only given life to the priest of the novel, but also showed the new but clear path life took for Armenians after the massacre.
It is interesting how the novel became life and life became a tale, a fairy tale life.
As an audience, we said good night with difficulty, as we felt part of the fairy tale.

The sixth gathering of Hamazkayin’s book lovers’ club focuses on Kevork Emin (Canada)
It was one of the bright summer Sundays on July 29, 2012 at 2:30 PM.
A group of book lovers flowed into the Haroutioun Manoogian Library of the Armenian Center, while an anthology of poems by Kevork Emin was recited through a video shown on a screen.
Megheti Mnatsaganian, a member of the Literature Committee, welcomed the attendees and after featuring briefly describing the book lovers’ club she presented Tamar Najarian.
The latter is the representative of the Toronto Armenian youth who are the bearers of Armenian education.
She has graduated from the everyday Armenian school of ARS and has received a higher education in psychology.
She is also an active member of ARS, Armen Karo, the Canada Youth Association of ARF, as well as a newly joined member of Hamazkayin.
Najarian comprehensively featured the Armenian poet Kevork Emin (1918-1998.)
Kevork Emin was born in Ashtarak, on September 30, 1918.
He received his basic education in his hometown and then moved to Yerevan, where he studied at the Polytechnic Institute.
To improve his innate talent and literary knowledge, he studied at the House of Armenian Art in Moscow, as well as followed higher courses in literature.
He was enchanted by Charents.
He contributed to and was editor for several literary magazines, as well as a lecturer of Armenian literature at the University of Moscow.
He was a laureate of several literary prizes.
He achieved fame through his poetry volumes; “Nork,” “Voronoumner” (“Quests,”) “Yergou Janabarh” (“Two roads,”) “Minchev aisor” (“Till today,”) “Ais Darikoum” (“In this age,”) “Ksanerort tar” (“Twentieth century,”) as well as a journalistic volume titled “Yot yerk hayasdani masin” (“Seven songs about Armenia.”)
“There are plenty of warm feelings and emotions in the lines by Emin, but he is more renowned for his civil and patriotic topics, were he sings about being Armenian, the love of the fatherland and of human beings,” Najarian said.
“Emin is a master of concluding a poem with powerful and emblematic descriptions.
He has also done a great number of translations.”
Najarian chose poems that appeal to the heart of the listener and distributed copies to the audience. The poems included “Zarmanali hay” (“Incredible Armenian,”) “Badkam” (“Message,”) also known as “Speak carefully in Armenia,” “Anbadaskhan hartse” (“Question left unanswered,”) “Dkhour kef” (“Sad party,”) and the very well known “Menk” (“We.”) She read the poems with clear intonation and full of emotion.
She also read “Der Zor,” which she said had impressed her from an earlier age; as well as very short, but eloquent poem titled “Microphone.”
A video film was presented and featured excerpts from “Sassountsineri bare” (“The dance of people of Sassoun,”) one of the more famous works by Emin.
A discussion followed during which the audience spoke about the bold and natural writing style of Emin, the character of the Armenian people, his lines that penetrate into the depths of current situations, as well as Emin’s palpable and undeniable patriotism.
Towards the end of the meeting Megheti Mnatsaganian thanked Tamar Najarian for her carefully prepared presentation and gave her a volume comprising the best Armenian poems by Hamo Sahyan and Vahagn Davtyan.
“This gathering helped me to deepen my study the poems by Kevork Emin that I have loved ever since I was a child,” Najarian said.
“I encourage the Armenian youth to take part in these gatherings. Our writers have great work to share with us and it’s a pity if we happen to be ignorant of the rich world of Armenian literature,” she said.
The audience greatly appreciated the presentation.

Theater performance in Paris
The Hamazkayin theater group staged Hagop Baronian’s satirical play Shoghokorte (“The Flatterer”) in three acts, on Sunday, 7 October 2012, at the Rossini Hall in the ninth municipal arrondissement in Paris. The play was directed by Simon Mnagian.
The play’s main character is Babig, the Flatterer, who thanks to his innate talents can find his way out of the most difficult situations. In fact, he is the one who causes those difficulties with his flattery that stimulates people, thus leading to complex situations.
The play wraps up with the general conclusion that all this is the result of a misunderstanding.
For more than an hour, the audience “compensated” the actors with their laughter for their excellent performance.
The actors were Maral Harboyian playing the role of Partem, the housemaid; Garbis Bdghouni as Tateh, the 60-year-old householder who has fallen in love with 20-year-old Sophie; Ani Ipejian in the role of Tereza, Tateh’s 40-year-old sister who is in love with 20-year-old Arshag, Tateh’s adopted son; Simon Mnagian as flatterer Babig; Raffi Ipejian as Arshag, who has two loves: Armenian poetry and Sophie; and Zabel Kasbarian as Sophie, who loves Dikran — played by Armen Minasian — and not the other two who are in love with her. Dikran Krikorian played the role of Hovsep, Sophie’s father, who no longer knows who is his daughter’s lover that is supposed to settle his unjust debt. And Harout Harboyian played the role of Kevork, the butler in Hovsep’s house.
The stage design was done by the actors themselves (Raffi Ipejian, Dikran Krikorian, Garbis Bdghouni, and Armen Minassian). Arthur Khachoyan was responsible for lighting and sound, Alexan Mnagian for music, Shant Harboyan for administrative affairs, and Sosseh Mnagian for stage direction and make-up.

Theater performance of the satire “Alafranga” (Paris)
The Theater Troupe of Hamazkayin in Valence was invited by the Hamazkayin Chapter in Paris to perform Hagop Baronian’s satire “Alafranga” to the Armenian community in Paris, on Sunday, November 24, 2013.
Originally, “Alafranga” was written in Turkish, with Armenian letters. As it was explained in the performance booklet, “from 1840–1870, a literary tradition of writing in Turkish with Armenian letters became widespread in Constantinople, as a means of educating Turkish-speaking Armenians. Eventually, however, with the opening of Armenian schools, this trend phased out.”
If we replace Turkish with French, the topic becomes relevant to the Armenian community in France and elsewhere, where the need for Armenian community schools is great and where Armenian-speaking theater performances are rare occurrences.
However, the audience, who had filled up the Rossini Hall in spite of the bitter cold weather, embraced the performance and the issues it discussed, and expressed its thirst for performances in Armenian.
The actors were all talented young Armenians from France, Lebanon, Syria, or Armenia.
This successful and contemporary production of “Alafranga” presented Baronian’s play through a novel and interesting approach of shadow theater and quick interruptions of black-and-white films.
The Hamazkayin Chapter in Paris truly thanks Simon Mnagian and his theater troupe, as well as each and every actor for the great performance.
It also thanks the audience and the municipality of the 9th arrondissement for providing the theater hall.
After its performance in Paris, “Alafranga” will be staged in Lyon, Nice, Valence, and Marseille. It will also tour in Brussels and Geneva.
Theatrical Evening in Cyprus
On Sunday, January 15, 2017, the "Mask" Theater Group of ″Oshakan″ Chapter of Hamazkayin Cyprus performed the "Super Boeing" comedy, directed by Harout Tahmazian.

Before the performance, Executive Board Chair, Arto Tavitian delivered a speech saying that besides other comedies, it was the 15th performance of the "Mask" Theater Group since the Chapter's establishment in 1999.
He thanked the director and actors of the performance, and especially the stage decorators, which had spent long hours to make the stage decorations of the performance.
The theater hall of Russian Cultural Center of Nicosia was filled up, and the people really enjoyed the performance from the beginning to the end, as well as the marvelous play of actors Harut Tahmazian, Nazareth Adrian, Arax Kyureghyan, Zhina Nokoghosyan, Sonia Chilinkirian and Marcia Adrian.

They expressed their admiration and highly praised the Hamazkayin "Mask" Theater Group's director and actors for this successful performance and for making the theater lover Armenian society of Cyprus really happy and joyous.
Thirteenth Volume of “Materials for a History of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation” Launched in Beirut
The Hamazkayin Vahe Setian Publishing House, in conjunction with Aztag daily, on July 13, 2020, held a book launch for Niuter HH Tashnagtsutian badmutian hamar (Materials for a History of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation), volume 13, edited by Yervant Pamboukian. The event was held at the newspaper’s Pyunik Hall.
Hagop Havatian, director of the publishing house, opened the event. He said documentary publications like this one are “the greatest response” to critics of the history of the A.R.F. At the same time, the mass of people who are interested in knowing how the A.R.F. has existed and made a difference through 130 turbulent years will benefit from the book. 
The book, Havatian noted, covers the years 1916 through 1918 in 448 pages.
Going over the contents, he said the A.R.F. played a “fundamental role” in those years leading to the establishment of the modern Armenian state.
“This volume, an initiative of the A.R.F. Bureau, was compiled through the efforts of historian Yervant Pamboukian, a long-serving A.R.F. activist and educator, a walking encyclopedia,” he said. The pace of Mr. Pamboukian’s activities, and his energy “is contagious and worthy of respect—not just for members and supporters of the A.R.F. but also for academic circles in Armenia and even the anti-A.R.F. segment of the population.”
Three Armenian Satirists Celebrated in Cyprus
On June 12, 2019, Hamazkayin’s “Oshakan” Chapter in Cyprus hosted the final event of their 2018–19 season, an evening to celebrate three Armenian satirists, Hagop Baronian, Yervant Odian, and Ler Kamsar.
Arto Tavitian spoke about satire, explaining that its purpose was to educate by subjecting human weaknesses to mockery and laughter.
He focused on three big satirists in Armenian literature, telling the life stories of Baronian, Odian, and Kamsar. He said each writer lived in very difficult circumstances but was able to use satire to criticize the ugly behavior they saw around them, as well as its consequences.
Then, excerpts from Odian and Kamsar were read. Members of the newly formed “Hekiat” youth theatrical ensemble, directed by Harut Tahmazian, presented select scenes from Baronian’s Honorable Beggars, receiving warm applause.
As usual, the evening ended with a reception.
Three-Volume Textbook on Modern Armenian Literature by Moushegh Ishkhan Republished
Moushegh Ishkhan’s three-volume Modern Armenian Literature was republished by the Hamazkayin Vahe Setian Publishing House.
Garo Hohannesian served as copy editor, Meghri Shammasian as publication designer, and Ankine Khederlarian as typesetter.
The first volume, Renaissance Period, encompasses the years 1850 through 1885. The second, Realist Period, covers 1885 through 1900. The third volume, Aesthetic Period, brings the story through 1915.
Moushegh Ishkhan covers almost a century of important and representative Armenian literary figures and poets: their biographies, notes on their works, commentary on their literary characteristics, and some sample writings.
To make the study of the meaning, depth, and literary values of their works easier, Ishkhan has provided guides to vocabulary and exercises.
The book includes not just major authors, but also writers who may not be as prominent.
In presenting literary figures, Ishkhan has been guided by three principles: specificity, simplicity, objectivity.
Ishkhan provides a short historical sketch of the political, social, cultural, and linguistic conditions in each timespan to help the reader understand the differences in character and artistic conceptions of the different generations of authors.
The readings from each author give a good sense of the author’s style, as well as their artistic conceptions or the circumstances in which they lived, wrote, and died.
In some instances, Ishkhan provides expositions on literary genres and styles.
The volumes are practical and accessible textbooks. They make the work of Armenian literature teachers and students alike easier.
As a pedagogical tool, the work does not get into lengthy and deep analysis.
Ishkhan has provided students with what they need to know about each author’s value and characteristics.
Rather than engaging in abstraction, he has brought together judgments that have withstood the test of time.
Ishkhan’s goal was to present modern Armenian literature in an accurate and easy-to-digest way.

To the memory of Arshak Galstaun
It is with deep sorrow that we announce the death of our dear and highly regarded friend, Arshak Galstaun.
We express our sincere condolences to Mrs. Sophie Galstaun and the Galstaun Family, as well as to the family of Hamazkayin in Australia.
The worldwide Hamazkayin family and the Central Committee of Hamazkayin greatly appreciated Mr. Galstaun’s devotion to the Armenian school and Armenian education.
It is due to him that the Djemaran of Hamazkayin in Australia was created, and therefore was baptized in his name: Arshak and Sophie Galstaun Djemaran of Hamazkayin.
There are people who find the meaning of their lives in donating their time and money, and are thus immortalized. One of those immortals is Arshak Galstaun.
Married to Mrs. Sophie Galstaun, Mr. Galstaun formed a typical Armenian family, which always prioritized national interests over personal ones.
Their home became a little Armenia: their breath and their spirit were Armenian.
Although they did not bear their own children, they became second parents to thousands of Armenian children with their generous donations, and gave life to the all-important task of Armenian education.
It is with his deeds that Arshak Galstaun will live forever within our hearts.

Literary Unit member Satenik Gharabaghtsyan opened the event, noting that the literary unit had a specific program of drawing in young people, bringing forth their talents, and providing them with a platform, to encourage their integration into the ranks of Hamazkayin members.
This approach led to an unprecedented event, which took place in Hamazkayin’s newly renovated center.
In the first place, Allen gave a practiced and confident presentation, illustrated with slides, about the religious movements and their role in the Armenian Church’s religious conceptions—which can even be seen in the thinking of Saint Gregory of Narek (951–1003).
Allen gave his presentation in fluent Armenian. It had all the characteristics of a university lecture. It remains only for him to complete his education.

Tsaghkunq of Hamazkayin (Canada)
There can’t be any significant progress in our life without hard work. What we do becomes more meaningful and the future success is guaranteed if we strive for it collectively and contribute to it individually, and share everything we have.
After all, as Tekeyan said, we still have what we give to others.
The Tsaghkunq musical evening organized by the Gladzor Chapter of Hamazkayin was a celebration of mutual love, confidence, respect, ″rise and help to rise″, and of our united efforts.
It bridged the professional, talented artists and the promising young ones and was the result of their months’ or even years’ work. Tsaghkunq was their Native Home, the Cherry blossom, love and peace, survival, hope and light coming from the past and going to future. We really enjoyed on those festive days leaving aside all our troubles.
On Saturday, December 16, 2017, the theater hall of the Hamazkayin Armenian Youth Center was full of Armenian and foreign guests who were carefully reading the program list, which included classical, lyrical, and folk songs in the Armenian, English, French, Italian, Russian languages. The performances were accompanied by the piano, duduk and kanon music, as well as dances by graceful Armenian girls.
No need to say that we anticipated having a magnificent, rich and diverse evening.
Soloist Minne Tsaturian developed her immense love and interest towards singing being a member of the Hamazkayin Armenian Stars Choir. She achieved brilliant results participating in the contests of the Royal Conservatory of Music. Her vocal teacher is conductor Hripsime Tovmasyan.
A 12th grade student Minne has already won a number of awards and has given many solo performances.
Some of the adult soloists of the Armenian Stars Choir that have always impressed the audience with their harmonious vocal talent and beautiful voices, were going to join Minne on the stage. One of them was Sevak Haroutiunian, honored by the audience for his unique voice and impressive interpretations. The other was Levon Karagyulian, born in Aleppo and recently settled in Toronto. Levon has already participated in our many events enriching the program and charming the audience with his beautiful voice.
The next participant of the program was the kanon player Matiana Torosian. She has also participated in our cultural events and has greatly charmed the audience. Our thousands years old purely Armenian instrument duduk in the hands of Seyran Ghazaryan gave a new charm to the fabulous musical evening. The next was the professional pianist Talin Artinian Gelebozian whose solo performances and accompaniments have fascinated us over the years.
The graceful girls of the Erebuni Dance Ensemble of Hamazkayin, directed by choreographer Arevik Martirosian, gave an additional fragrance to Tsaghkunq.
We are so lucky to have a talented pianist and accompanist such as Vanik Hovhannesian who exerts every effort for the success of the Hamazkayin Armenian Stars and Gusan choirs.

On the occasion of the 90th anniversary of Hamazkayin, on the first weekend of March 2018, the Board of Kaspar Ipekian Hamazkayin Theater Company organized Vardan Petrosyan’s performance at Hagop Der Melkonian Theater Hall. It was a great joy to see the humorist, actor and painter Vardan Petrosyan again and to enjoy his latest solo performance entitled My Unfinished Song.
Petrosian's performances generally refer to our everyday life, problems, concerns, emotions and dreams, but this performance is about the last bitter experience of his life.
He has returned to the stage to continue the song that was left unfinished a few years ago, when the day before his performance, he had a heavy car accident, for which he was sentenced to five years of imprisonment․
The artist intended then to sing a song with his audience at the end of that failed performance. However, the performance did not take place, and he did not sing that song, but after being released from prison, he wanted to sing that unsung song now.

The host of the event was the representative of Sanahin Chapter's Literary Committee Anahid Balian.
She welcomed the guests and spoke about the newly published books, which are neither literary creations, nor documentaries or photographic albums but are valuable pieces of medical literature in Armenian.
In contrary of the fact, that many Diaspora doctors reach professional achievements at international level, this medical literature has had very modest achievments so far.
This gap is obvious also in the Armenian press, where one can find relatively very small number of health and medical special articles.
Dr. Garbis Harboian is well-known in the Montreal Armenian Community. A. Balian briefly presented his biography, noting that after finishing his medical studies at the American University of Beirut, Harboian continued his training in the treatment of ear, nose, and throat disorders.
He worked as a surgeon for decades and published a series of medical research articles, leaving his mark in the international medical literature. Dr. Harboian’s medical and health articles, lectures, and radio programs in Armenian serve as a great benefit to the Armenian society.
He volunteered his assistance in the humanitarian and health-medical centers and hospitals in Lebanon, actively contributed to the national public life, and assumed important responsibilities and posts.
In appreciation of his many years' service, the Jinishian institution granted him Certificate of Merit and the Hamazkayin Central Executive Board awarded him the Hamazkayin Medal.
Before one of the most prominent figures of the Community, Senior Editor of Horizon Weekly and Horizon Literary, Vrezh-Armen Artinian would present his close friend Dr. Harboian’s books, Anaհid Balian briefly presented Artinian’s life and career achievements. She spoke about his collection of traveler's memoirs entitled Web 1, Web 2, Web 3, and Web 4 and informed that Web 5 and Web 7 will soon be published online.
In appreciation of his tireless diligence and contribution to national or public life, and for his dedicated service to literature and culture, the Great House of Cilicia awarded Vrezh-Armen Artinian the Mesrop Mashtots Order.
Vrezh-Armen spoke about Dr.Harboian’s rich literary merit referring to his books consisting of 214 articles. "Those articles concern not only the doctor's specialty in ear- nose and throat (ENT) diseases, but also many diseases and pains, in which people are generally interested. They give the reader useful knowledge about health and medicine, and are written in clear and understandable language.″
Speaking about the 126-paged glossary in "Doctor's 4th Word" Volume, as well as the new list of Armenian terms proposed by the author and editor, Vrezh-Armen said, ″Perhaps the author’s most important contribution is the development of our language, explaining the existing medical-scientific terms, and proposing new ones."
Vrezh-Armen concluded his speech by encouraging the audience to purchase those valuable medical books.
The next speakers were Quebec Armenian Medical Association member, Dr. Ohan Tabakian and vice president of the same association, Dr. Sero Andonian. They highly appreciated Dr. Harboian’s work.
Doctor Tabakian congratulated the author and expressed his opinion about some of the terms included in the list of new words in Armenian.
Later, Anahid Balian invited the author to speak.
Dr.Harboian made a heartfelt speech and thanked the Armenian Department of Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation for financial support, the Catholicos of Great House of Cilicia Aram I for his encouraging support, His Grace Bishop Meghrig Parikian for writing the preface of the book, his close friend, Dr. Vazgen Ter-Kalousdian for the professional editing of the content of book.
He expressed his special gratitude to Vrezh-Armen Artinian for presenting the published books and for doing linguistic and general editing.
After expressing his gratitude to Quebec Armenian Medical Association and the Executive Board of Hamazkayin Sanahin Chapter and the host of the event, Anahid Balian, Dr. Harboian mentioned that initiating this work he wanted to help the Armenian people to get some medical and health care knowledge and advice in their own mother tongue.
Toward the end of the event, Q&A part started, after which Anahid Balian congratulated the author and expressed her gratitude. The participants of the event in a cordial and friendly atmosphere congratulated the author and received the books gladly signed by him.
The evening continued with treating coffee and delicious biscuits.

6th of January, 2018
Over the last few weeks, we have followed press reports of developments at the Hamazkayin “Sos Sargsyan” State Theater in Armenia. We are concerned about the situation that has developed there.
The Hamazkayin Educational and Cultural Society has traveled a long path with the Hamazkayin Theater without having any legal ties with it.
It was no coincidence that the theater established by legendary doyen of Armenian theater and cinema, Sos Sargsyan, was named Hamazkayin.
In the early 1990s, the Hamazkayin Educational and Cultural Society and the Hamazkayin Theater were established in newly independent Armenia together, and worked hand in hand.
In 1991, through the efforts of veteran artists including Sos Sargsyan, Hamazkayin established an office in Armenia. A few years later, Sos Sargsyan initiated the establishment of the Hamazkayin Theater, having the support not only of the Hamazkayin office in Armenia but of the entire venerable worldwide network of Hamazkayin.
While the Hamazkayin Theater later received the “State Theater” designation, it remained in the center of attention of Hamazkayin and enjoyed its ongoing support.
The Hamazkayin Theater and Hamazkayin Society have a very important characteristic in common: loyalty.
The successive central executive boards of the Hamazkayin Society continued faithfully to sustain the theater, and the theater’s creative crew continued faithfully and with unstinting dedication to serve the theater and aid its success.
After Sos Sargsyan’s death, the Hamazkayin Theater continued with its mission, thanks to Sos’s worthy heirs, who developed as artists in this theater, remaining true to Sos Sargsyan’s legacy—a legacy before which every Armenian bows his or her head.
The theater-going public has formed a high opinion of the activities of the Hamazkayin “Sos Sargsyan” Theater. It is our collective responsibility to secure its future.
We all have a moral obligation to guarantee the continued activity of the theater, in Sos Sargsyan’s spirit, creating an atmosphere conducive to artistry, far from sectarian or individual interests, founded in comity and mutual respect.
No one has the right to harm the Hamazkayin theater that is the fruit of Sos Sargsyan’s superhuman efforts and bears his name.

We Remember the Ethiopian Armenians (Canada)
The Hamazkayin Sanahin Chapter’s Executive Board organized an interview meeting with Rubina Svajian, the author of the book In the Shadow of the Sultan. Rubina Svajian was invited from London to give an interview at the meeting entitled We Remember the Ethiopian Armenians. The event took place on Wednesday 21 June 2017, at the Avedis Aharonian Hall of the Armenian Center.
60 book-lovers that were mostly Ethiopian Armenians attended the event.
The Board’s Literary Committee member Anahit Balian welcomed the guests saying that in different periods of our history, the invaders, seeing the Armenian people’s creative spirit, bright mind and diligence, deported them from their native lands so that they would contribute to the prosperity of other foreign countries.
″We have read also about the people who survived the Armenian Genocide instigated by the Ottoman Empire in 1915. Those people were exiled from their homeland. They settled in foreign countries, and greatly contributed to the progress of all those hosting countries.
However, it is interesting to know when and how the Armenians reached Ethiopia and what kind of contribution they made there.″
As soon as Noyemi Lakhoyan, a former graduate of the National St. Hagop School, read Rubina Svajian's biography, and then invited her to the stage, the author answered to all those questions.
In her speech, she told how Armenians since ancient times had been trading with Ethiopia, how they settled there and built schools, churches, and clubs. Armenians contributed to the development of Ethiopia in various fields.
It was very interesting to know how Hailee Sallasi (who later became the Emperor of Ethiopia), during his visit to Jerusalem in 1916, listened to the band consisting of 40 Genocide survivor orphans, asked Yeghishe Archbishop Durian to take them to Ethiopia.
The conductor of the same band, Kevork Nalbandian, later wrote the national anthem of Ethiopia.
As for the other spheres, Mrs. Svajian said that the Armenian merchants had always brought their significant contribution to the economic life of the country, while the Armenian artisans and artists, such as jewelers, ironmongers, and painters cooperated with Ethiopian kings and made their marks on Ethiopian elite.
There were also Armenian pharmacists, architects, musicians, senior military men etc.
As appreciation for their accomplishments and loyalty, the Ethiopian authorities rewarded many of those Armenians.
At the end of the event, Mrs. Svajian answered the questions and signed the sold books.

WikiCamp in Syria Builds Western Armenian Presence on the Internet
A recent WikiCamp in Syria served as part of an initiative to make Western Armenian an Internet language through Wikipedia. Initiated by Wikimedia Armenia, the program enjoyed the generous support of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, which has been focusing on increasing the day-to-day use of the Western Armenian language.
The camp was held from August 27 to September 1 at the Levon Shant Hall of Aleppo’s Aram Manoukian House in cooperation with Hamazkayin’s Regional Executive Board for Syria.
The workshop leader was Western Armenian Wikipedia manager Azniv Stepanian-Arpajian, who had come from Armenia.
The objective of the workshop was to train Wikipedia editors and coordinators to develop the Western Armenian Wikipedia and to spread the idea of participating in Wikipedia.
During the camp, participants did hands-on writing and editing work. The workshop was attended by 25 individuals of various ages.
Working five hours a day, participants learned how Wikipedia works, and got experience with its editorial tools and policies. They wrote and published articles in Western Armenian.
On the fifth day of the camp, young editors joined the participants to learn about Wikisource, “an online community, where Western Armenian books are scanned and digitized.” They learned to digitize books and practiced correcting typos and formatting issues generated in the digitization process. The hope was that the participants would continue this effort.
At a celebration following the workshop’s closing, Ms. Stepanian-Arpajian thanked Hamazkayin’s Regional Executive Board for Syria for agreeing to host the program.
She also thanked the participants, who used every means they could to preserve the Western Armenian language, which is currently classified as an endangered language; they worked hard in the belief that Wikipedia is a platform that allows people to use Western Armenian in their everyday lives.
Berj Boghigian, chairperson of Hamazkayin’s Regional Executive Board for Syria, said that the organization hosted the camp because they believe the Aleppo is a city with a vibrant Armenian presence and will continue as a core to nourish and spread the Western Armenian language.
He thanked Ms. Stepanian-Arpajian, a graduate of the Hamazkayin Armenian Studies Institute in Aleppo, for bringing this program to Syria. He hoped that the Western Armenian Wikipedia initiative would serve to keep young Armenian interested in the language, and that they would use the tools provided to them to do the best possible job. He wanted them to learn, while pursuing the mission of preserving Western Armenian with meticulous attention.
Next to speak was the prelate, Archbishop Shahan Sarkisian. He reflected on what he called the positive and negative aspects of the Internet, inviting participants to work consciously and fastidiously to maintain the integrity of Western Armenian.
His Grace appreciated Hamazkayin for its cultural mission and thanked Ms. Stepanian-Arpajian for her work in developing the Western Armenian Wikipedia project.
His Grace handed certificates of participation to the participants. Hamazkayin Central Executive Board member Garo Alexanian and the chairperson of Hamazkayin’s Regional Executive Board for Syria were present.
After cutting a cake, everyone celebrated.
With Vehanoush Tekian (Canada)
The Armenian language is the source of Armenian identity.
For centuries, along with faith and Homeland, the Armenian language and Armenian literature have preserved Armenians as Armenians.
The Armenian writers and poets are noble heroes that crystalize and refresh the Armenian language.
On October 17, 2017, the Armenian Community of Montreal hosted one of those writers, a respected and unique personality - Vehanoush Tekian.
The Literary Committee of Hamazkayin’s Sanahin Chapter organized the presentation of her books Prayers in a Fishnet and The Story of the Speaking Mountain, at the hall of the National Prelacy of Canada, in the presence of the community’s book lovers.
Anahit Balian, a member of the Literary Committee, delivered the opening speech. She welcomed the guests noting that we need to know our values, history and literature for the survival of the Armenian people, and should appreciate our intellectuals who revive and enrich our native language, as they brighten our thoughts and ennoble our souls with the brightness of their mind.
Referring to Vehanoush Tekian, a renowned figure of our contemporary literature, Anahit Balian mentioned that the author often has a communal alarm and conveys an important message to her reader. Therefore, it is necessary to read the author’s works and to understand her thoughts.
Anahit Balian briefly presented Vehanoush Tekian’s biography and read the 100-year-old poet Jack Hakobyan's opinion about the writer. "In the treasury of the Armenian Literature, Vehanoush Tekian is a writer with a unique and exceptional pen.
One cannot read only a paragraph, a page, or even a book of hers and stop. She is extremely interesting.
She is the pioneer of her generation by her poetry and prose.
[...] Her language is flexible, and it attracts the reader.
In this regard, her language is a great achievement in our literature.
She has a unique place in the Armenian literature due to her rich harvest of literary works, her brilliant and fluent language, literary style and cognitive world."
After presenting the writer to the audience, the hostess of the event invited Haroutiun Berberian, Pakin Periodical’s former editor, poet and author of literary analytical articles, to the stage to speak about Vehanoush Tekian’s poetry, and particularly the book Prayers in a Fishnet.
Berberian said: "Prayers include the person’s deepest inner, and even personal feelings and thoughts, and their being in the fishnet can lead to a variety of controversial interpretations.
Were those prayers caught by the author, or were they caught in the net?"
Then he added. "In her poems, the author transforms her personal concerns into literature in a witty way and through humor.
Beyond her personal concerns, she is deeply concerned with Armenian issues, as well as general or universal threats."
Referring to each of them and citing some beautiful excerpts from Tekian’s poetry, Haroutiun Berberian said that the book included prayers caught in the fishnet and prayers fled away through the holes of the net. Nevertheless, there were also those prayers’ echoes as psalms, which were not only benedictions, but also lamentation and a call for help. He noted that the poet is continuously in quarrels, doubts, or pleadings, questioning and talking to the Lord, her God and to all sacred.
Moreover, she manages to do all of this ignoring the poetic traditional forms, and giving a completely new portrait to her poetry″.
Then, A. Balian presented Raffi Ajemian, an Armenian writer from Montreal, known from different literary magazines. He was invited to the stage to introduce Tekian’s prose, particularly the book The Story of the Speaking Mountain.
Before presenting it, Raffi Ajemian touched upon Tekian’s previous prose writings one by one - Cracked Miniature, Family Tree: Short Stories, and Character. He read some excerpts from the stories and expressed his impressions.
Raffi Ajemian brilliantly analyzed the author's unique and sweet style, emphasizing that the stories included in Tekian’s four volumes are read eagerly, and their main subject is related to Homeland and the Armenian language.
The speaker said that in her prose writings, the author also touches upon the loss of Beirut city, and in her famous article The Final Crisis in Western Armenian she speaks about the Armenian language, its loss and preservation.
Coming to the book The Story of the Speaking Mountain, Ajemian said that it is a collection of writings and speeches written or spoken by the author on various occasions.
There are also writings and analyses related to our well-known writers Misag Medzarents, Vahan Derian, Daniel Varoujan, Vahan Tekeyan, Jack Hagopian, Mushegh Ishkhan, Hagop Garapents and others.
"The fact that the author of those writings is a writer herself gives an additional color and a great deal of value to this book.
The reader feels affinity as the writer’s inner feelings are very clear, and you even feel her heartbeat under every line of her writings. There is a passionate love and care for the language, especially for the Western Armenian language," said Ajemian.
Then, Anahit Balian invited the multi-talented and distinguished author Vehanoush Tekian to speak.
First of all the writer said that she had succeeded both as a poet and a prose-writer due to Pepo Simonian’s encouragement, and she had published her first book considering Kourken Mahari’s, Garig Basmadjian’s and Razmig Davoyan’s appreciations.
In her speech, Tekian emphasized the importance of the first published book in the life of any writer, and advised all those who love to write to publish their writings.
Then she expressed her gratitude to the Armenian Community of Montreal for the warm reception, to Hamazkayin Sanahin Chapter and Anahit Balian, the organizer of literary events.
She also mentioned that the Armenian writers had to fight in the vast multifaceted Diaspora, multicolored cities and multicultural environments, and they managed to create through their original talent and distribute it to their people.
″This was the case with Haroutiun Berberian and Raffi Ajemian,″ she said, expressing special gratitude to them.
She also thanked Horizon’s former editor Vrezh-Armen Artinian and present editor-in-chief Vigen Abrahamyan, and Pakin’s editor-in-chief Sonia Sanan Kiledjian
Vehanoush Tekian figuratively presented Mesrop Mashtots’ return to Armenia with the invented alphabet, which brought immortality to the Armenian people.
"The Armenian Literature has one Home," she said, "the roads that lead there are numerous and diverse, and the only force that makes Home an impregnable fortress is the Armenian language."
After Vehanoush Tekian’s meaningful speech and her poems, Anahit Balian expressed her respect and gratitude to the author that perfectly conveys her feelings and experience through her beautiful language and glamorous ideas.
She especially thanked Haroutiun Berberian and Raffi Ajemian, who thoroughly and in a skillful way presented the author’s books.
She closed the literary evening with her gratitude to the guests for their interest, encouraging them to read Vehanoush Tekian’s books in Armenian.
At the end of the event, the author signed the books, and the guests were invited to a reception.

Women in Armenian Literature, Part 1, Covered in Montreal Course
Women in Armenian Literature, Part 1, was the second topic covered in the Levon Shant Armenian Studies course led by Dr. Viken Tufenkjian. The program took place on January 18, 2020.
Dr. Tufenkian himself was the speaker. He gave an overview of the historical and social circumstances in which feminism developed in England and France.
He then presented the first Armenian feminist journalist, Elbis Gesaratsyan, and her work.
Dr. Tufenkian spoke about the portrayal of women in a few novels and stories published in the late nineteenth century, such as Dikran Gamsaragan’s The Teacher’s Daughter, Yerukhan’s The Amira’s Daughter, and Krikor Zohrab’s novels. He then focused on the life and community work of Zabel Asadour (Sibil), a vigorous advocate for the education of Armenian young women.
He presented a few of her stories. Then the students discussed her “Honest Feminism” dialogue, and the model of womanhood found in that work.
In the second part of the lesson, the students became familiar with the life and work of the first Armenian woman novelist, Srpouhi Dussap. They discussed three of her works, Mayda, Siranush, and Araksya Gam Varzhuhin (Araksya or the teacher). These works portray the difficulties faced by widowed and single women, the misfortune of women in forced marriages, and issues of children’s upbringing.
At the end, the students had written assignments. They wrote letters to Dussap discussing their reactions to the topics covered in the class and their thoughts. Some of the letters were read aloud to the class.
Wonderful Evening in Pafos
Saturday, March 3, 2018, was an unbelievably beautiful evening in Pafos.
For the first time, the Ani Dance Ensemble of Hamazkayin gave a performance for the Armenian community of Pafos. Almost the entire community attended the event and enjoyed the truly Armenian evening. The dance performance based on Hovhannes Tumanyan's fairy tale The Death of Kikos was really enjoyable.
State Councilor of the Armenian Community Vardges Mahtessian and his wife, as well as the entire staff of the Hamazkayin Executive Board were present at the event.
The program began with the opening speech of Hamazkayin Forum member Mariam Masurian, followed by the brief speech of Hamazkayin Cyprus Chairperson Arto Davitian.
He said that it was a great pleasure for him to be in Pafos and a double pleasure for Hamazkayin Cyprus Executive Board to enjoy the performance of the Ani Dance Ensemble, which had been established due to the efforts and contribution of the Armenian community of Pafos and the Hamazkayin Committee. He expressed special thanks to Irina Masurian for her consistent and diligent work.
Then, Arto Davitian presented two panels of appreciation in the name of Hamazkayin to Irina Masurian and Vardan Mkhitaryan, the President of the Armenian Community of Pafos.
The performance started, and the 23 members of the Ani Dance Ensemble courageously and with great pleasure performed The Death of Kikos. The parents and guests enjoyed the performance with greater joy and excitement and appreciated the performance with ovation.
For this success, we should express our gratitude to choreographer Grigor Kheleshian and Irina Masurian who gathered the little Armenian children from Greek schools who could hardly speak Armenian, and established the ensemble a year ago.
Good job and congratulations to everybody, also to Committee member mothers who honored the guests with lavish hospitality.

Zaruhi Babayan and Sona Rubenyan Perform in Lebanon
Armenian songs play a pivotal role in Armenian culture.
For centuries, Armenian song has ennobled, inspired, and recharged the souls of generations of Armenians.
It is, of course, beyond doubt that in the mission of maintaining the Armenian language and Armenian identity, a special importance is reserved for Armenian music.
We owe much to the estimable composers, creators, troubadours, choirs, and interpreters of Armenian song who kept the flame of Armenian culture burning and relayed it to the present generation.
This effort is born of the deep conviction of a faithful constellation of artists who have given everything and asked for nothing back.
The events marking the ninetieth anniversary of the establishment of Hamazkayin are, in their breadth, direct messages to the Armenian people, calling on them to own Armenian culture and hand it down as a legacy to the next generations.
The Regional Executive Board for Lebanon, faithful to the path chosen by the founders, through a series of events, bequeathed a garden to Lebanese Armenians, bringing beauty and nobility to listeners’ souls.
The last event took place on February 25, 2019, at the Hagop Der-Melkonian Theater in the Bourj Hammoud district of Beirut, where artists Zaruhi Babayan and Sona Rubenyan, from Armenia, performed.
That the hall was full of music lovers was an indication of the success of the concert.

She confirmed that the Armenian songs express the Armenian people’s everyday life, their behavior and morals, the rural life and habits.
Mentioning that the trio members represent such Armenian songs and music through their A Cappella singing, she said that their only musical instrument is their vocal cords.
Menar Boyadjian stated that through their performed songs the members of Zulal Trio confirm the importance of preserving and promoting the Armenian sweet melodies and folk songs.

The Zvartnots Choir, directed by Kayane Simonian Derian, accompanied by Ruzan Barsumian on piano, held performances on April 16 and 18, 2021, at the K. Esayan Hall in Aleppo. The event was held under the auspices of Bishop Masis Zobouyan, Armenian Prelate of Syria, and was organized by the Zvartnots Choir Executive Board, a unit of the Hamazkayin Regional Executive Board. The Zvartnots Choir has been a gathering place for choral talent and a beacon for the community for a half century.
The program included the most difficult “O Fortuna” by Karl Orff.
For this and some other pieces, Ms. Barsumian was joined on a second piano by Lizet Seraydarian, who for many years served as the choir’s accompanist.
Attending the first performance were the prelate and representatives of the Armenian Catholic and Evangelical communities, the Consul General of Armenia in Aleppo, the consular representative of the humanitarian mission of Armenia, member of the Syrian parliament Jireyer Raasiyan, representatives pf the Hamazkayin and Homenetmen Central Executive Boards and of Aleppo-Armenian cultural, benevolent, compatriotic, athletic, and educational organizations, along with the music-loving public.
The concerts started with the national anthems of Syria and Armenia.
Rita Gaghian gave an opening address in Armenian.
She said, “In the difficult days of history, Armenian songs and music have kept Armenians company. They have expressed the suffering of our fiery spirits, our faith, our love and sadness.
Hamazkayin, as a conservatory of culture, well aware of the educational role of art, and especially song, dance, and music, has taken ownership of our lofty national values, and presents them on the stage with taste.
For half a century, the Zvartnots Choice has maintained a special place in the life of Aleppo Armenians. It has made generation after generation aware of not only Armenian but also non-Armenian and classical song.”
Zvartnots Preformed Choral Music Treasures for the Armenian Community in Aleppo
On Sunday, March 26 and April 2, 2017, the Armenian Community of Aleppo enjoyed two unique concerts of noble, gentle, amazing and emotional choir music by the Hamazkayin Zvartnots choir. 
The performance awakened the audience’s most sacred feelings and pride of being Armenian.
The choir’s triumphant concerts included foreign and Armenian music, which penetrated deep into the heart, mind and soul of the charmed audience and took them to the land where the Armenian melody and culture were born.
The high quality two-day concerts of Zvartnots Choir, conducted by Gayane Simonyan-Derian and accompanied on piano by Ruzan Barsoumian, confirmed that the Armenians, despite all difficulties and challenges, know how to live with dignity, preserving the language, culture and values, which give strength and power, as well as will to live and continue the struggle.

Archbishop Shahan Sarkissian, Armenian Catholic Community representative Priest Gomidas Dadaghlian, President of the Armenian Evangelical World Council, Reverend Harutyun Selimian, and RA Consul General in Aleppo Tigran Gevorgyan, representatives of national, cultural and charitable associations attended the concert.
Under the auspices of Bishop Masis Zobouyan, Armenian Prelate of Syria, Hamazkayin’s Levon Shant chapter on February 21, 2020, organized an event to commemorate the Battle of Vartanank.
The event was held at the Aharonian Center.
A member of the chapter executive board, Maral Katklian, greeted all those present, and said that Vartanank is one of the most important national-religious celebrations of the Armenian people. She added that proudly remembering is not enough to guarantee the survival of the Armenian nation and church; we must become the worthy heirs of the heroes of Vartanank, conscious of the value of our identity, loyal to our Christian faith and patrimony, keep the Armenian language pure, tell our stories and reproduce our culture, and pass them on, generation by generation, as traditions and holy relics.
The artistic program followed. The prelate then spoke from his heart, saying that the Battle of Vartanantk was a heroic battle for the Armenian people, where Armenian heroes fought to protect Armenia, the language, and the culture.
He gave high praise to the students, whose songs and recitations are keeping the spirit of Saint Vartan alive.
The bishop connected the victorious path of Vartanank to the latest victories in Syria, especially the complete liberation of Aleppo, emphasizing that when there is willpower, vision, loyalty, and a willingness to sacrifice for the homeland, that is the moment when all liberations occur.
He emphasized that the year 451 is a cornerstone in Armenian history, a stone that crushed all efforts to alienate Armenians and the treaty that emerged in 484 guaranteed the freedom of conscience of Armenians and the independence of Armenia.

“Aras Publishing and Istanbul-Armenian Literature” is Topic of Montreal Talk
The Istanbul-Armenian Cultural Centre in Montreal on January 17, 2020, hosted a talk featuring Istanbul-based writer, teacher, translator, and editor Sevan Deirmenjian. The talk was titled, “Aras Publishing and Istanbul-Armenian Literature.”
The talk was organized jointly by the Istanbul-Armenian Society’s “One Culture Committee” and the Hamazkayin Literary Committee.
Raffi Ajemian presented the speaker on Hamazkayin’s behalf.
After outlining the speaker’s biography, Mr. Ajemian touched on the topic of the day.
Mr. Deirmenjian first spoke about the history of Armenian publishing in Turkey before the establishment of Aras Publishing in the 1990s.
He then turned to the demographics of contemporary society in Turkey and reading habits there.
He spoke about a few Armenian writers active in Turkey, such as Mıgırdiç Margosyan from Dikranagerd, Hakob Mndzuri, Zaven Biberyan, and Zabel Yesayan.
It was interesting to learn that Turkish society demonstrates special affection and care for these writers, from whose work it was deprived until the 1990s.
The publishing house, to balance its budget, has published some of the works of these authors in Turkish translation. The translations have proved popular and the print run has been doubled in some cases.
The same is true of children’s publications.
At the conclusion of the talk, participants had a chance to ask questions. Books published by Aras were sold.
The publisher’s website is at https://www.arasyayincilik.com

The soul and life are dominant themes in the book and there is a call from the village—from the depths of the heart and soul, toward life. There is a smile there, where we see the poet’s soul.

“Azat Or” Interviews Hamazkain ’s Arin Kalousdian on Children’s Programs
Hamazkayin has created children’s game apps. How many games? How can they be played?
The children’s games division of Hamazkayin has created children’s educational games for the iOS and Android platforms. The games are aimed at children ages 3 to 5. They are in Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian. 
Three free apps are in operational use. “Kuyneru Ashkharh” (The world of colors), “Tseveru Ashkharh” (The world of shapes) and “Kireru ashkharh” (The world of letters).
The developers were guided by contemporary pedagogical principles.
The following were considered:
What is the purpose of the program?
The program is purely educational; without pressure or obligation, playing, the child internalizes colors, shapes, and letters, learning new Armenian words.
Play is one of the best ways of teaching Armenian because whatever the child learns playing, she or he accepts with pleasure.
The heroes of all these games are children.
The children learn with greater pleasure because their peers accompany them.
The main characters and Lala and Ara. They accompany the players, give them hints, and teach them through play.
Lala and Ara are curious and alert.
They encourage the player, give tips, and provide help when help is needed.
The games have clear rules. The directions are brief and given in simple sentences so the children can follow them with ease.
When the player answers correctly, she or he is given encouragement. When there’s a misstep, the player is encouraged to try again.
Throughout the game, the children are independent.
They click around on their own, they try things, they find thing, they learn, they are evaluated and they evaluate themselves.
The program helps children teach themselves.
The games are varied and have a rich vocabulary.
Listening and trying, the children overcome language problems. They try to understand instructions given in Armenian, and follow them.
Later, they try to repeat the instructions.
The games develop the children’s senses of hearing, sight, and touch.
Children learn about the world around them through their senses.
Most actions are accomplished by fingertip.
For example, the fingertip dips into the virtual paint to paint the picture.
To encourage the children and press them ahead, there’s always feedback.
Every time a child finishes a game, Ara or Lala says, “Abris!” If a child fails to complete the game, Ara or Lala says, “Try again.”
Do you have any other initiatives alongside the game apps?
Yes. Listening to the pedagogues, we have created various objects and toys (such as wallpapers, stickers, t-shirts, jackets, backpacks, pencil cases, dolls, pillows, and the like).
Lala and Ara stickers are on all the objects and when the children use them, Lala and Ara are always with them.
Foreign heroes are replaced with Armenian ones.
Where do you sell these objects?
We have a website http://www.lalanouaran.com as well as a presence on the social media sites Facebook and Instragram and it’s possible to order through any of these. In every community, the Hamazkayin board and community center can provide the objects directly or order them.
The Western-Armenian-speaking Lala and Ara dolls have been a hit with the kids.
They are made in Yerevan, at the Mankan factory.
What are your plans for the future?
Before answering this question, I must confess that the world of children is huge and very few Armenian games and toys are out there. So Hamazkayin decided to enter this arena and generate new environments for children.
Yes, we have some plans—stories appropriate for children, with Lala and Ara as the heroes; we will publish books and videos, with music, through our YouTube channel.
We have other plans too, which will have to come as a surprise to our beloved children.
Do you have anything to add?
Yes, in conjunction with a private initiative, we recently gave room on our website to “Cluster of Tales” (Voghguyz me Badmvadzk), which features readings of stories in Armenian.
Stories are excerpted from Levon Shant’s “Mangagan Ashkharh” series.
Cluster’s mission is to bring joy to children and teens through pleasant storytelling, and to create an interest in reading and Armenian books.

The satirical work kept the audience engaged from beginning to end, spreading happiness and high spirits.
The author and director, Garo Khachigian, has remained faithful to theater and his love for the art showed.
Being an actor, playwright, and director in Armenian theater, especially in the faraway and peaceful shores of Australia, where assimilation takes its toll, takes courage and persistence.
The play was a balm for the public, exhausted with their daily struggle.
The 19 young players took the stage with skill and were believable in their roles.
Their energy brought the play to life and kept the audience laughing.

“Gomidas” is in Fresno
Once again the star of Fresno shines.
This time it is Hamazkayin’s star.
Specifically, the Hamazkayin Fresno “Taniel Varoujan” Chapter invited the Armenian Youth Association of California “Gomidas” Choir to perform.
The concert took place at the Armenian Presbyterian Church on February 16, 2019.
Notwithstanding pouring rain and challenging travel conditions, it became possible to have a successful event thanks to the joint efforts of the “Gomidas” choir and the chapter executive board.
The choir consisted of 45 singers and its conductor, Mikayel Avetisyan.
Pianist Hovsep Torosyan dedicated time out of his busy schedule for this concert, for which we are especially grateful.
Overcoming the harsh winter conditions, he was able to return to Los Angeles the same night.
Nazik Arisian, the chapter president, opened the concert with words of welcome.
She took the opportunity to thank Hamazkayin’s founders, as well as the founders of the chapter.
She stressed the main mission of the chapter, which is to help maintain Armenian identity through cultural creation.
She then presented the choir, which looked beautiful on stage.
For the first part of the program, the choir presented classical songs from Gomidas and other authors.
The audience was visibly appreciative because the carefully curated list of songs was rich with folk songs like “Im anush davigh,” “Lerner hayreni,” “Mardigi yerke,” and “Ichav marmant irigun.”
“Hamshen at the Crossroads of Past and Present” Shown in Glendale, California
On November 16, at the Glendale (Calif.) Central Library, Lusine Sahakyan’s documentary, Hamshen at the Crossroads of Past and Present, was shown. The showing was organized by Hamazkayin with the Asbarez daily. In the 18th century, in the Rize province of the Ottoman Empire, in the districts of Çamlıhemşin, Ardashen, Hemşin, Pazar, Çayeli, and İkizdere, Armenians were forcibly Turkified.
The documentary shows the life of this community over several generations. Some continue to speak the local Armenian dialect. They live in Turkey’s Artvin province, in the Hopa and Borçka districts.
As a result of urbanization, it is possible to meet groups of Hemshinlis in Istanbul and other cities. Hemshinlis who continue to profess Christianity can be found on the Black Sea litoral. 
The documentary shows the way of life, daily routines, songs, dances, storytelling, traditions, cuisine, games, and sayings of the Hemshinlis who converted to Islam. It also shows their sense of identity.
The Hemshinlis, living on the foothills of towering mountains, in the lush green of a gorgeous nature, use Armenian words in their Turkish dialect. These are Armenian words pronounced in a distinctive way.
Though they have lost their identity as Armenians, they take pride in their identity as Hemshinlis. This is a heartache for many viewers, and they appreciated the connection that the filmmaker had created between them and the Hemshinlis.
The documentary is rich with dialog, conversations, a feeling of closeness between the viewer and the subject.
Lusine Sahakyan also expertly gathered on film the Armenian artifacts that remain in the Hemshinlis’ environoment: place names, prayers, sayings, stories, and the like.

For the small community of Limassol, this number has no recent precedent.
The smooth performances of the teenaged actors were received with joyful applause. All were hopeful that Limassol could host more such events in the future.
The Hamazkayin Limassol Taniel Varuzhan Chapter was formed with just that proposition in mind. Its “Giligia” children’s dance group represents a great first step. The Nicosia chapter is lending experience and other support to the new group.

“Hrant Dink” Foundation and ″Hamazkayin″ Organized Joint Academic Conference in Istanbul
The ″Hrant Dink″ Foundation and the Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society organized a joint academic conference in Istanbul on October 7-8, 2016, entitled “Critical Approaches to Armenian Identity in the 21st Century: Vulnerability, Resilience, and Transformation”. The Conference was organized under the auspices of the "Calouste Gulbenkian" Foundation in Lispon and the Sweden Consulate General in Istanbul.
The Conference took place at the "Forum" Hall of "Immaculate Conception" Building of "Hrant Dink" Foundation.
"Hrant Dink" Institution holds annual conferences, which raise important issues, give full coverage to the past and analyze the present.
Such were the Conference of Islamized Armenians of 2013, "The Social and Economic History of Mardin and the Region" Conference of 2012, and the Conference of 2011, dedicated to Tigranakert Armenians.
The agenda of the last Conference, as the event's title reminds us, was also very important, interesting and relevant.
This international conference brought together Armenian, Turkish and foreign experts, and public figures from Turkey, Lebanon, Armenia and from different places, the names of which are worth mentioning - Khachig Tölölyan, Rubina Peroomian from the United States, Hratch Tchilinkirian from London, Razmik Panossian from Lizpon, Meguerditch Meguerditchian, Vatche Papazian, Anita Toutikian from Beirut, Harutyun Marutian, Suren Danielyan from Armenia, Murat Cankara, Pınar Karakılçık, Ararat Şekeryan from Turkey.
The reports presented in English, Turkish or Armenian were being simultaneously interpreted.
The conference began with "Hrant Dink" Foundation Board President Rakel Dink’s and Hamazkayin Central Executive Board Chairperson Meguerditch Meguerditchian’s opening speeches.
Dink said that discussing the Armenian Identity from the point of Turkish identity is an opportunity to get rid of Armenophobia.
Explaining his views on the Armenian identity Meguerditch Meguerditchian said that the one who considers and characterizes himself as ″Armenian″ is Armenian.
Then Prof. Khachig Tölölyan from the United States made the first report entitled ″The Confusion of identities in modern rhetoric". In his report, he, in general terms, defined the core of the conference.
Meguerditch Meguerditchian conducted the first session of the Conference entitled "Conceptual Discussion".
After Hratch Tchilinkirian’s ("What is the ″Armenian″ in Armenian identity") and Razmik Panossian’s (Homelands and Diasporas: Building a Multilocal National Identity) reports, the speakers answered questions from the audience.
The sessions were entitled "Post-Genocide Expressions", " Diaspora Identities & Spatiotemporal Dimensions", "″Armenian″ as National Identity", " Religious Limits of Armenian Identity", "Armenians in Turkey," " Identity Representations in Literature". They discussed the 4th generation’s perception of the Armenian Genocide, the relations of art and collective identity, transnational Armenian feminist dialogue, varied experiences of Armenians in Aleppo, Tbilisi, France, America, Romania, Jordan, Turkey, Bourj Hammoud, expressed in the national-religious, language mentality, socio-linguistic and literary spheres.
At the end of the Conference, a press conference was held entitled "Modern usage- future directions".

The reports will be published in a separate volume.
PARTICIPANTS’ FEEDBACK
Meguerditch Meguerditchian (Hamazkayin Central Executive Board Chairperson) - First of all, let me say that to the diversity of audience is very impressive.
There are representatives and reporters from various Communities of the Diaspora and Armenia, and in fact, the event turns into a scientific meeting.
It is the first attempt of collaboration between the Hamazkayin Society and "Hrant Dink" Foundation that, in my opinion, is very successful.
If there are some imperfections, they can be everywhere.
Nevertheless, from my talks with the participants of the Conference, I came to an opinion that all of them had very good impressions and wish such initiatives be organized repeatedly even on the same topics, because within two days we could only present the situation, and couldn’t talk about what we can do, and we didn’t clarify our goals.
As you see, there are difficulties with such a busy program and with presenting all of the existing materials.
Razmik Panossian ( "Calouste Gulbenkian" Foundation) - It was an interesting academic conference for a few reasons.
First, it showed the different corners of the Armenian identity.
We spoke about things, which it was impossible to speak about 20 years ago.
Second, organizing such a conference 100 years after 1915 in Istanbul, which was one of the centers where the Armenian identity was created, is very important and symbolic.
Here we can speak about identity and future.
And surely from organizational point of view it was also very interesting.
Such an important institution based in the Diaspora as Hamazkayin jointly organized the Conference with "Hrant Dink" Foundation.
This means the three aspects - the subject, organization and location, were very interesting.
Hratch Tchilingirian (Oxford University lecturer) –It should be said that these two days were exceptionally successful for me.
I am especially contented that "Hrant Dink" Foundation and "Hamazkayin" organized this event jointly.
To gather and discuss the issue of Armenian identity in Istanbul seems to be very significant and valuable in the life of Diaspora, because our Western identity was born here. That is why we not only feel contented in academic sense, but also spiritually.
It is an important factor, in my opinion.
The Conference not only brought together experts from various countries and universities, but also bound us to this important Armenian institution.
Speaking about the second value, I would like especially to emphasize the role of the "Hrant Dink" Foundation in the diaspora.
The institution is a new light in the life of Diaspora. In a very short period, it could carry out progressive and lively activities as regards its program. I consider this a huge success in our life.
Why?
During the past 100 years, our Diaspora structures seem to be exhausted and dispirited for some reasons.
Nevertheless, again, there in the heart of our western culture, an institution has emerged called "Hrant Dink" Institution, which is an important light in our life of Diaspora. I believe it will bring novelty at least in the Middle East and Europe.
Pınar Karakılçık (INALCO) – It was a very successful, and entirely professional Conference.
No scientific conference of such level had been organized in Turkey so far bringing together so many experts.
Therefore, from the point of future activities related to the Armenian studies, it was really a useful event.
It combined us, and we became aware of the work of Armenologists or experts from other spheres in Turkey or elsewhere.
It is very good and encouraging.
Hülya Adak ("Sabancı" University) – The reports made during the Conference "Critical Approaches to Armenian Identity" offered us a lot of new approaches on literature, linguistics, socio-linguistics, anthropology and history.
I hope "Hrant Dink" Foundation will publish those reports in a separate volume.
Particularly there were issues unknown to us, for example, the reports about the Turkish dialects spoken in Bourj Hammoud, or the reports about martyrologies, the language issue based on their translations, which prompted us to think whether Genocide had a language.
Did the Genocide perpetrators have a special language? Was that a chosen way?
Why, for example, some martytology writings were in Turkish but written with Armenian letters?... Those were questions, which were first laid in front of us.

“Khrimian Hayrik” Performed in Montreal
On April 6, 2019, at the Sourp Hagop Armenian Cathedral in Montreal, Dr. Herand M. Markarian performed his play Khrimian Hayrik. The event was organized by the Hamazkayin Montreal “Sanahin” Chapter Executive. Students from the three area Armenian schools, Sourp Hagop, AGBU Alex Manoogian, and Armenian Catholic Nareg, played roles. Representatives of organizations attended, as did the theater-loving public.
Speaking on behalf of the board, Anahid Balian welcomed the audience and reflected on the life of Khrimian and on the long service of Dr. Markarian, and the awards won by him, as a director, actor, and activist.
Ms. Balian also thanked the six young people who played roles in the production and the administrators of the three schools, the children’s Armenian and Armenian history teachers and parents.
She emphasized that Dr. Markarian’s performance had a purpose beyond art: the proceeds would underwrite the provision of lifesaving equipment to soldiers in Artsakh.
In costume as Khrimian, Dr. Markarian took the stage and began his performance.
He presented the clergyman born in Van as Mgrdich, his education under his paternal uncle, his marriage and fatherhood, his years in Constantinople, his travel in the provinces, and his ordination as a doctor of theology after the death of his family.
The monologue covered the life of Mgrdich Khrimian as a clergyman: the books he wrote, his activities, his persecution in the reign of Sultan Abdulhamit II, his exile and return, his service in Constantinople, Ejmiadzin, Van, and elsewhere, and the role of dark-minded clergymen in undermining him.
We saw how he got the title “Hayrik” (father) through his efforts to awaken the consciousness of the people in the provinces.
When Khrimian went to Berlin (in 1878) for the peace talks following the Russo-Turkish War, the children in the cast and actor George Darakjian played the parts of representatives of foreign powers.
Khrimian went on to make his famous call to arms, in which he reported that they were handing out porridge in Berlin; while other had iron ladles to collect their shares, he had showed up with paper only, and his paper ladle had collapsed in the pot.
The performance continued with the confiscation of Armenian church properties under the Tsar (in 1903) and Khrimian’s refusal to cooperate with the authorities. Here, too, the children had a role in the play.
The play ended with a final speech and the recital of the Lord’s Prayer by the children.
This work, written by Dr. Markarian, is a masterpiece. He presented it with exceptional acting skill, embodying the caring clergyman who suffered with his people and defended them, especially those in the regions, as well as the Armenian Question in foreign tribunals.
He successfully portrayed a courageous shepherd who stood tall against persecution.
In his fluent style, using simple and accessible language, he was able to draw in the audience and convey Khrimian’s messages.
He occasionally switched to the Van dialect of Armenian, adding verisimilitude to the presentation.
A reception followed. The playwright’s books were offered for sale.

“King, Wake up” Musical Performance (Lebanon)
Aztag Daily informs that on March 3 and 4 of 2017, at Hagop Der Melkonian Theater Hall, the Hamazkayin Arek theatrical group performed the "King, Wake up" musical comedy, based on the fairy tale by Hovhannes Toumanyan Jug of Gold. The artistic director Robert Arakelian staged the performance. Gayane Dance School participated in the performance in the head of dance instructors Karen and Jacqueline Makinian spouse.
Similar to Hovhannes Toumanyan, Robert Arakelian had found a gold jug in his village. He had decided to write an up to date Armenian play based on Toumanyan’s Golden Jug tale.
Arakelian tried to connect the subject of the play with our daily life, which was reflected in the massages conveyed by the story. For example, the King governing the people was always asleep, or the gold in the found jug characterized the two of our new generation: a girl and a boy, which in the end, seized the king's throne. Thus, the new ones substituted the old, and the new was evaluated. In other words, the meassage of the play was that the new generation would certainly come to govern and provide brilliant future.
About 85 students took part in the performance, from which the 35 were the memebers of Arek theatrical group. Each of them brilliantly played his role. The rest were Gayane dance school students who performed for 4 dances.
“Kousan” Choir Celebrates Komitas’s 150th Anniversary
Sponsored by Hamazkayin’s Beirut “Gomidas” chapter, organized by Hamazkayin Regional Executive Board for Lebanon, the Hamazkayin “Kousan” Choir held a concert to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Gomidas’s birth in a fitting manner.
Conducted by Krikor Alozian, with Hasmig Kasbarian accompanying on piano, on the evening of July 30, 2019, the National Evangelical Church was full of Gomidas and Kousan fans as well as official guests.
Those present included representatives of the three Armenian church communities, other Christian communities, representatives of the Armenian Embassy and other embassies, members of Parliament, members of the Hamazkayin Central Executive Board, the Regional Executive Board for Lebanon, and the Beirut Gomidas chapter.
The church was full of active Hamazkayin members, alumni of the choir, and many non-Armenian guests.
The concert began with Garen Arapgirlian’s comments. After that, the choir sang “Sird im sasani,” during which young people held candles in memory of Gomidas, in front of his picture.
Audience members were transported to 1935 and the death of Gomidas, and the choir expressed its respect for its founder.
The men of the choir sang part of Gomidas’s Divine Liturgy, with Avedis Akrabian singing the solo parts.
It was “Kousan,” led by Gomidas himself, that first sang Armenian church music, the sharagan and the treasure, in Istanbul, offering the pearls of Armenian culture to the entire world.
“Kusan” Choir Performs in Philokalia Cultural Society’s Christmas Festival in Lebanon

It is a tradition for “Kusan” to have a Christmas concert on December 29.
Before the pause imposed by the coronavirus, the choir usually performed in the city of Jebeil on that day.
“Letter to Yerevan” Launched in Watertown
On March 21, 2019, at the ACEC in Watertown, an event took place celebrating the launch of the English translation of Andranik Tzarukian’s epic, iconic “Tukht Ar Yerevan.”
There were 150 people present at the event.
Verginie Touloumian was the emcee, and after welcoming everyone, said that the translation of a colossal and history-making book like Letter to Yerevan is an opportunity for Armenians who do not read Armenian, and for non-Armenians as well, to learn about the conditions under which Andranik Tzarukian wrote his epic poem.
Rupen Janbazian spoke next. He was the book’s co-translator, and spoke on the impact the book had on him.
When he attended ARS schools, his teacher would recite Tzarukian’s poem without error.
“I had, of course, read Tatul Sonent’s literary translations in the past, and had met him a couple of times.
However, four years ago I had the opportunity to join the Armenian Weekly’s editorial staff. In the venerable Hayrenik building, I had the chance to become close friends with Tatul.
His office became my classroom, where I learned so much about literature and the art of translation, especially.
In one of our loooong chats, we started asking ourselves why a work like Letter to Yerevan, which at the time of its publication sold like fresh bread, and is considered one of the masterpieces of diaspora Armenian literature, has been practically forgotten, especially by the new generation.” said Janbazian.
“Letter to Yerevan” Rocks the Boat Again After 75 Years
It is not every literary creation that succeeds in roiling still waters with big circular waves, like a stone hitting a lake.
Andranik Tzarukian’s book-length poem Tught ar Yerevan (Letter to Yerevan) has made waves since its original publication in Aleppo in 1944.
The poem is framed as a response to a resentful, minor Soviet Armenian poet, Gevorg Abov, and his short poem, “Menk chenk moratsel” (We have not forgotten). Tzarukian’s work took the entire Armenian diaspora by storm.
For those Armenians who have been around for at least half a century, the work might have been seen as a bittersweet memory that could serve as a nostalgic read; after the fall of the Soviet Union, one might have thought, this sort of literature might have had no reason to be command renewed attention—least of all among readers who had never known a world that featured the USSR.
But the literary evening showed an entirely different reality.
Mr. Melkonian, noting the exceptional success of the evening, said, “I confess, when the Sardarabad bookstore asked us to organize this launch, I said skeptically, that Letter to Yerevan was obsolete and few people would care to attend.”
But to the great surprise of the Literary Committee and the older generation in Los Angeles, the book has generated the kind of interest today that it generated 75 years earlier.
This is why many chapter of Hamazkayin have undertaken to organize events around the publication of the English translation of the book.
In the Los Angeles area, the Western U.S. Regional Executive Board’s Literary Committee, in cooperation with Sardarabad Bookstore, Asbarez daily, Hairenik Weekly, the Shant Student Association, and the AYF, did its part, organizing an event on March 19, 2019.
“Lireon Khayr” Documentary Shown in Cambridge, Ontario
On September 16, 2022, the Hamazkayin Cambridge (Ontario) Chapter Literary Committee hosted a showing of the documentary Lireon Khayr (Blessing of the Mountain), which is about Musa Dagh and the history of Ainjar Armenians. Over a hundred people attended the event at the Postanjian Hall at the Cambridge Armenian Centre.
The emcee was Azig Kevorkian, who talked about the nature of the documentary, noting that it was prepared by Tamar Shahinian, well known as the director and a host of the Hay Horizon television station.
The emcee announced that the proceeds from the event would be donated in their entirety to cover the financial needs of Ainjar Armenians.
The event started with a moment of silence for the Armenian soldiers martyred in the recent invasion of Armenia.
After some announcements about future programs, the video was shown.
The hall became very silent as the audience was transported to the homeland with its bubbling springs.
The audience experienced the dream of being on green fields.
The moment passed quickly but it gave insight into the secrets of the psychology of survival of the Armenians of Musa Dagh.
At the end, the chapter expressed it gratitude to the producer, Tamar Shahinian, saying, “You have added another link to the chain of your service and perhaps words are not adequate to characterize your selfless devotion to the Armenian community.
Let your optimism and industry inspire and support every Armenian and every Hamazkayin member.
On everyone’s behalf, we congratulate you.”
Through applause, the audience asked the producer to say a few words.
Tamar Shahinian highlighted the persistence of the Ainjar Armenian community and said it was part of the Armenian homeland.
Shahinian praised the chapter for its activities and for mobilizing the community.
A deacon, Razmig Garbushian, closed the event with a blessing for Armenian soldiers.

“Localities and Armenian Church Properties in Ottoman Turkey; Heritage Targeted for Destruction” Book Launched (Paris)
The presentation of this very interesting book, organized by the Hamazkayin Paris Chapter, took place on Monday, November 28, 2016, at the Armenian Cultural House.
The book "Localities and Armenian Church Properties in Ottoman Turkey; Heritage Targeted for Destruction" summarizes the works of four researchers, Harutyun Khachatryan, Patrick and Lucy Aslanian, and Jean Michel. They studied this issue for many years, making a list of the Armenian Church properties in Ottoman Turkey at their own expense. In their research, they used a list of 1913, prepared by the Patriarchate of Constantinople by Ottoman order.

With a donation of more than $1 million USD, they brought the current building of Djemaran to life, thus impacting the mission of educating generations and empowering them to preserve their Armenian identities.
Jinbashian said: “They were rich, but they were rich in their souls, as well, because it was with great content that they made their noble donation.
Haig Arslanian carried out the word given by his brother, Melankton (who died in 1986,) and today they have immortalized their names, and as the poet says, ‘Only the work is immortal.’
Today we might feel like an orphan in the light of the deaths of first Melankton and then Haig, our benefactors, but we will remember them every single day, because Djemaran will keep going for years under the names of Melankton and Haig Arslanian.”
Following the principal’s speech, the audience honored the memory of Haig Arslanian with a moment of silence. The burial service will take place Saturday, October 22, in Belgium.

The Armenian community of Nicosia got the opportunity to watch the film "Salvation Map" on Thursday, November 17, 2016 at Nicosia University’s "Cine Centre" Hall. The organizer of the event was the Hamazkayin "Oshakan" Chapter in Cyprus. The film is about the life of five missionary women from northern Europe.
Those five women were Maria Jacobsen and Karen Jeppe from Denmark, Bodil Katharine Biørn from Norway, Alma Johansson from Sweden and Anna Hedvig Büll from Estonia.
Five sacred women, who left their calm and prosperous life, listened to the voice of God and their conscience, rushed to Western Armenia and Cilicia and established orphanages.
They were eyewitnesses of the Armenian massacres and genocide.
After being deported from Turkey, the five selfless women, who had been named as "Mama" by the huge army of Armenian orphans, returned to Middle East and again established orphanages and refuges, and continued to save the survived Armenian orphans.
The producer of the film Manvel Saribekyan was invited to take part in the presentation of the film. The participants of the event were deeply impressed by the film, its subject, and quality. It could really be compared with the best contemporary European films.
In his brief opening speech before the screening, Manvel Saribekyan explained how difficult the conditions, under which the film was produced, were.
He said that it is possible now to watch the film in eight different languages, and the Turkish version of the film will soon be also available.
Listening to the opinions of people leaving the hall, one with no hesitation could say that the audience highly appreciated the film.
"Ardzagank" magazine editor Arto Tavitian said that the film's producer, Manvel Saribekyan deserves high appreciation for making such a film.
It is a high quality film, which in the best way represents the Genocide issue to foreign circles.
Owner and editor of the "Cyprus Armenians" website Simon Aynedjian noted that this film is one of the powerful propaganda weapons in the struggle for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, and it should definitely be screened for the Cypriot Turks, when its Turkish version is ready.
The owner and director of "Mouflon" Library Ruth Keshishian expressed her admiration noting that such creations undoubtedly make our voice heard, especially when they present foreign witnesses testifying and speaking about the Genocide.
The audience congratulated the Hamazkayin Executive Board, which despite the difficulties growing day by day, seeks to keep alive the community's cultural life through such activities.

“The Italian Straw Hat” Performance (Canada)
Recently the "Betros Atamian" theater group of the "Sanahin" Chapter of Hamazkayin Montreal, in the context of cooperation between the Canadian Chapters of Hamazkayin, performed "The Italian Straw Hat" comedy in Toronto.

The Hamazkayin “Gladzor” Chapter of Toronto invited the theater group to perform the comedy, and Two Masks Theater was the organizer of the performance, which took place on Saturday, December 10, 2016, at the "Hamazkayin" Theater Hall. It was a great chance for the Armenian Community of Toronto to enjoy the performance full of so many ridiculous epizodes and situations, where the Italian straw hat, in unexpected and weird circumstances, became a real treat for its recipients, for those who accidentally see it, and for the foreigner groom ready for marriage.
The audience really enjoyed the fun-filled performance consisting of 5 acts.
The large number of actors displayed very active play on the stage. Their continuous movements, group exits, and entrances made an impression of a beehive.
Not only the highly professional play of the main role actors, but also the play of the secondary role actors impressed the audience.
The troup reached this success due to the hard work of its beginner or experienced 24 actors playing primary or secondary roles, and also thanks to the respectable director’s skillful staging, which really deserved appreciation and encouragement.
After four successful performances in Montreal, the troupe performed "The Italian Straw Hat" for the Armenian Community of Toronto, which also enjoyed it very much.
At the end of this initiative, Vice Chairperson of the Hamazkayin ″Gladzor" Chapter, Ara Hasserjian thanked the large family of "Betros Atamian" theater, as well as those who devotedly serve the Armenian culture and made great efforts for implementing this project.

“The Letters of Aram Manoukian” Launched in Beirut
A book launch took place on October 24 in Beirut for historian Yervant Pamboukian’s new book, The Letters of Aram Manoukian. Held at the Armenian Embassy under the auspices of the Ambassador Samvel Mkrtchian, the program was organized by the Hamazkayin Lebanon Regional Executive’s Literary Branch.
On the occasion, Hratch Dasnabedian’s edited volume Aram, rereleased with Garo Hovhannesian as editor, was also presented.
The evening’s program began with the national anthems of Lebanon and Armenia, followed by opening remarks from Jack Hagopian.
He said the newly formed Literary Branch saw fit to organize, as its first program, the launch of The Letters of Aram Manoukian, edited by Yervant Pamboukian and published by the Armenian Studies Research Institute of Yerevan State University.
He said, “We are used to presenting the greats of our history through their moral character, underlining their moral conduct, their chaste behavior, and exemplary life; we never delve into what they have to offer today to the new generation or to those at the helm of the ship of state.
In the Armenian reality, Aram Manoukian and his contemporaries moved the national-revolutionary agenda forward; they followed the national-revolutionary path, leading from almost nothing, through the daily thicket of revolutionary struggle and experience, to the establishment of an independent republic.
“The Little Statue of Hagop Oshagan” is the topic of a talk in Beirut
On April 11, 2019, Aztag newspaper’s Piunig Hall in Beirut hosted its 150th media seminar. The topic was “The Little Statue of Hagop Oshagan.”
Marine Ghazarian, a lecturer on contemporary Armenian history at Yerevan State University was the speaker.
Jacques Hagopian, one of the editors responsible for Aztag, opened the event. He helpfully enumerated the topics of the previous 149 seminars held by Aztag.
Noting that the topics included every matter of concern in Armenian life, he said the seminars played an important role in fostering thoughtful discussion. He hoped the platform continued to play a prominent role in Lebanese-Armenian intellectual life.
Dr. Ghazarian expressed gratitude to Aztag, Hamazkayin, and all who helped her in her work.
She found that Oshagan’s work united the spiritual and the instinctive. She emphasized that she studies Oshagan’s novellas and short stories, not his novels. Oshagan’s art, she said, encompasses life broadly and has artistic principles based on the notion that writing means entwining life.

“The Procession of Stars” Pauses in Athens
We hear the dhol. The musical “Procession of Stars” begins its journey from the Armenian Mecca, Mount Ararat, through the artisanship of the Armenian world and high art.
Vartan Badalian’s voice takes us through time, spirit and thought.
“Tamam ashkharh bdud yega” (I have traveled the whole world), says Sayat Nova, and assures his beloved that he found no one like her.
He pleads, “Sari sirun yar, sari mekhag per” (Pretty lover from the mountains, bring me mountain carnations).
Badalian is joined by Lusine Mirzakhanian, with her honey-sweet voice.
Magical, heartrending melodies are heard: “Grung” and “Bingeol.” The Naregatsi orchestra accompanies, under the able direction of Artem Khachatur.
The dancers of the Lusegh dance ensemble, taught by Suren Khachatryan, enchant us with their spry movements.
Instrumental music, song, and the “Henzeli” and “Kochari” dances take the audience to the Armenian highlands. On the screen, we see Armenian carpets and images of glorious places in Armenia: Ararat, Yerevan, Dilijan, Ani, Sardarapat.
On November 20, 2019, hundreds of Armenians and Greeks at the Christmas Theatre enjoyed an exceptional presentation.
The “Procession of Stars” was based on the story by that name by Hamasdegh.
The Hamazkayin Attica “Sos-Vani” Chapter Executive Board had arranged for 300 tickets, at special low prices, for Armenians and their friends, and had arranged for three buses to transport them.
Armenians far from Armenia, full of longing, always ask the “Groong” (Crane) “don’t you have a bit of news from our world?”
The conclusion is that in Armenia and the diaspora Armenians live, survive, and create.

An album titled, “The Revival of Armenian Statehood in 100 Pages,” was launched in Anjar, Lebanon, on September 22, 2018, at an event organized by Hamazkayin’s Baruyr Sevag chapter. Held at the Movses Der Galustian Hall of the S. Zetlian People’s House, the occasion celebrated the 27th anniversaries of the establishment of the Republics of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh and the centennial of the first Armenian republic.
Hakob Aintablian opened the festivities.
He said the book launch should be viewed as part of the celebration of the centennial of the first republic; the album, “The Revival of Armenian Statehood in 100 Pages,” with its beautifully rendered documentary photographs and scholarly commentary represents the first republic, its founders, and its fundamental accomplishments.
At the end of his speech, Mr. Aintablian said of the album, “This is an exceptional publication. The research articles are like newspaper pages. The previously unpublished photographs are a remarkable collection of archival documents. Launching such albums is the modest contribution of our district to the centennial of that fateful moment in our history, the establishment of the first republic, which saved us as a nation and a state”

“The Suspect” Staged in Montreal
On May 4 and 5, 2019, at the Montreal Sourp Hagop Armenian School hall, the “Bedros Atamian” Theatrical Group of the Hamazkayin “Sanahin” Chapter’s presented the comedy, “Gasgatzyale” (The suspect), directed by Lena Khacherian.
George Sarkisian had translated the screenplay. Lena Barsumian and Lena Khacherian had adapted it. Hagop Karayan prepared the décor. Lighting and technical matters were in the hands of Rupen Sarkisian and Serj Yesaian, staging was the responsibility of Ani Devarch and Tzovig Hayitian. Ms. Barsumian was also responsible for cues.
The three-act play portrays a large family living in Montreal that has its daily routine disrupted by a stormy event.
At the start of Act One, a newborn joins the family, and it’s the child’s secret that makes all the men in the family suspects.
The event serves as an occasion for every suspect to reflect on his recent secret actions and adventures, his lustful life and desires.
Difficult questions arise as the plot develops. Everyone’s family and love life is endangered as his secrets and immature missteps are revealed.
Names are named as each suspect tries to justify his own actions.
The tension peaks when the women in the family too get involved and seek out solutions. They don’t keep each other informed of their solutions, so there are comedic misunderstandings.
The mystery is solved unexpectedly in the final act. As that happens, all the outstanding issues are resolved favorably, and the suspects have their names cleared.
The exaggerations of the comedy bring out the good and bad sides of each character in a funny way.
The suspects’ panic and fear are palpable.
The comedy highlights the ups and downs of family life and how things can go wrong with tempers and a lack of communication.
The actors portrayed their assigned characters very capably and had good comedic timing.
The stage was decorated meticulously. The actresses were costumed well for their parts and their makeup and hair were excellent. The lighting and music were wonderful. All in all, the theater group put on quite the show.
Between the acts, coffee and sweets were served. After the show, the chairperson of the “Sanahin” Chapter Executive Board, Tamar Chahinian, took the stage to thank everyone.
Due to popular demand, an additional showing took place on May 10.

“Theater in Armenia Today” Explored in Lebanon
On April 5, 2019, Aztag newspaper’s Piunig Hall in Beirut hosted its 149th media seminar. The topic was “Theater in Armenia Today.”
The speakers were Arman Navasardyan, director of the Hamazkayin “Sos Sargsyan” State Theater in Armenia, and Narine Grigorian, artistic director of the theater.
Mardig Demirjian welcomed those in attendance and said the speakers would speak about theater in Armenia in general and at the Hamazkayin theater in particular.
Mr. Navasardyan described the way theater is administered in Armenia. He said theaters in Armenia are in crisis.

Central Executive Board member, Dr.Vigen Yacoubian spoke about the writer’s achievements in literature saying, "The distinguished writer Jack S. Hagopian’s first poem published in 1938 made certain that the young author will dedicate his pen to his worshipped nation forever.
I believe, that one day Jack S. Hagopian’s creations, symbolizing the multi-colored mosaic of the diasporic experience, will play a significant role in reunifying the Armenia-Diaspora roots."
Then, he invited Jack S. Hagopian to the stage and granted him the Highest Honor Medal of the Educational and Cultural Society of Hamazkayin.
The hero of the day expressed his gratitude to God, people and especially to the Central Executive Board of Hamazkayin for such honor and said, "This is one of the happiest moments of my life."
The audience expressed love and gratitude to the talented writer with ovation and inspired him to read his poem called "Today, my five years old boy".
The audience was attentively following the emotional recitation and enjoyed the poem, which showed the author’s anxiety about the potential assimilation danger and was directed to the parents, which enroll their children in foreign schools having no choice.
Jack S. Hagopian was in his element.
He had been awarded before by the Catholikoses, but this award was of special value, because the Festival reminded him about his drama "The Crane Calls" which he considered his life story happened at a crucial moment of his life.
This event was certainly another glorious page, which enriched the Hamazkayin’s treasury.
