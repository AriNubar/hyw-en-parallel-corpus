BUSINESS LETTERS
Advising a Youth to Stick to His Trade.
Dear Malcolm:
Your letter of April 24 reached me two days ago, but, not wishing to answer it hastily, I have delayed writing until today.
You write that Mr. D. offers to take you into his store, at higher wages than you are now receiving, and to arrange with your present employers to cancel your indentures, but that you like your trade and feel an interest in becoming master of it.
My advice, which you say you sincerely desire to have, would be by all means to continue in your present employment.
You will acquire a good trade that will always afford you the means of gaining a livelihood, and you will at the same time attain steadiness and perseverance.
I think it is the worst of all things in business, for a young man to fly from one pursuit to another, half learning a great variety of professions and trades, and mastering none thoroughly.
He thus acquires restless, discontented ideas, habits of irregularity, and generally ends by being good for nothing at all.
At Mr. D.’s you would occupy a very pleasant position, but you would learn nothing, and in a few months might be out of a situation, and forced to begin anew, with perhaps a loss of much that you have already learned.
I think it better for you, in every way, to steadily pursue your chosen trade until you have mastered it.
Hoping to hear from you again very soon, I am, as ever, Your affectionate cousin,
Agency.
Gentlemen:
Having removed to this city from Chicago, where I was established for many years as a general agent, I beg leave to offer you my services in that capacity.
Any business which you may intrust to my care I shall be happy to transact, assuring you that in combination with my experience in all matters pertaining to the great West, no care or attention shall be wanting on my part to secure your good opinion.
Respectfully yours,
From a Young Man Starting in Business.
Gentlemen:
Having one thousand dollars at hand I am desirous of entering into business, as a retail grocer in this city, and for that purpose, I ask you to forward to me the inclosed order for goods, needed, at the lowest figures, and upon the usual time accredited to those in my line.
I am permitted to refer to Messrs. Smith, Caldwell & Co.,  No. — Cliff St., and to my former employers, Messrs. Jones & Cook, No. — Water St., both of your city.
Very respectfully,
Reply to an Advertisement for a Salesman.
Gentlemen:
Having noticed your advertisement in this morning’s Herald, calling for the services of a salesman, I beg to offer myself as a candidate for the position, feeling confident that I am in every way qualified to fill it to your satisfaction.
Failing health determined me to withdraw from the house of Messrs. Bell & Co., of Front Street, general agents, in whose employ I had been for some years, and to whom I may refer.
Since that time I have been journeying from place to place renewing old acquaintances among our merchants, and obtaining introductions to many new firms lately commencing business.
From this you will perceive my assistance will be of benefit to my employers.
Waiting to hear from you, I am Respectfully yours,
Gentlemen:
In reply to your letter of this morning I must express my thanks for your kindness.
The salary is perfectly satisfactory, and I assure you that no pains will be spared upon my part to justify the confidence you place in me.
In the hope of an early intimation as to the date of my employment, I remain Yours respectfully,
An Inquiry for Lost Baggage.
The Baggage Master, N. Y. Central R. R.
Dear Sir:
I reached this city from Boston, which I left on the 12 P. M. train, 16th inst., arriving here yesterday morning at 7 o’clock.
While on the train I handed my baggage, check, No. 336, to the Express Agent, taking his receipt for it.
He has returned it to me, stating that my baggage has not yet come to hand.
It is a large-sized sole leather trunk, with my initials on each end, P. W.
Will you have the goodness to look it up without delay, and notify me as soon as it is heard from.
Yours truly,
Excusing Delay in Paying Rent.
Dear Sir:
I have been your tenant for over seven years and have always been prompt in paying my rent when due, but owing to the destruction of our factory by fire, and the impossibility of obtaining employment at present, I am obliged to ask your indulgence for a short period.
I am confident of soon securing another situation similar to the one I held in the factory, and will promptly cancel my indebtedness to you.
Regretting the necessity that forces me to ask for delay, I am Very respectfully yours,
From a Young Man Desiring Employment.
Dear Sir:
I am prompted by your kindness toward me while here last summer, to ask your influence in procuring me a situation in some establishment in your city.
The failure of the house with which I was connected having thrown me out of employment, and my disappointment at having been unable to obtain a position as yet, leads me to make this request.
Should you know or hear of anything that you consider adapted to my capacity, you will confer a favor by apprising me of it.
Respectfully yours,
Inquiry as to Country Seat.
Dear Sir:
Hearing of your intention to dispose of your country residence, and with a view to purchase, I address you in reference to the terms of sale.
May I ask you to communicate to me the precise location, number of acres the property consists of, with a description of the premises, stating the lowest figure at which a purchase could be made; also advising me what day and hour would be most convenient for examination.
Respectfully yours, C. B. Rollins.
Answer.
Dear Sir:
In answer to your letter of March 1 regarding the purchase of my place, I reply as follows:
The grounds are near Lowell, within twenty minutes walk of the depot, and consist of five acres of excellent farming land; the house is fifty by forty feet, built by day’s work for the owner’s residence, standing complete in every way and containing above twenty rooms, with all modern improvements; there are barns and outbuildings, selected fruit trees in abundance, etc.
The entire property I am willing to dispose of for twelve thousand dollars, net cash.
Any day, except Monday, will suit me to have you examine the premises, over which I shall be happy to accompany you.
I am Yours truly,
Complaining of the Price and Quality of Goods.
Gentlemen:
The goods invoiced to us April 19 arrived today.
We are sorry to say that the prints are not at all up to our expectations. Some of the patterns are defective both in color and design, and the quality of all of them is inferior.
This same grade of goods is being offered all around us at the same price that you charge us for them, so that we shall be unable to make enough on them even to pay freight.
We believe that you will find on investigation that there has been some mistake in packing these prints.
Kindly advise us in regard to this matter by return mail, as we prefer to hold the goods until we receive further advices from you.
Yours truly, Arthurs & Co.

I wish to leave because, owing to the dullness of the season, the proprietor cannot pay me what I think I should receive.
As you ask that the salary desired should be stated, I will say that my terms are $75 a month, with board, of course.

Gentlemen:
I am advised by a friend that you desire a representative to cover the Southern States.
I have traveled over this territory during the past ten years for Messrs. Hayes & Co., New York, who are going out of business on the first of the year, leaving me at liberty to form a new connection.

In the meantime I would respectfully suggest that you communicate with my former employers as to my ability, habits and attention to duty.

Yours respectfully,
An Emigrant Asking for Help When Midway on His Journey.
Dear ...,
I informed you that I had started to come to America.
I had prepared myself financially so that, after all expenses, I should have ten sterlings left upon my arrival there.
But circumstances changed things.
Being unused to sailing, seasickness weakened me so much that I was almost unconscious when we arrived at Marseilles. Armenian agents took me to a place (they call it their hotel) where I was left to sleep for a long time.
In the meantime I lost some money.
Later I learned from the doctors that my eyes needed treatment for about three weeks.
The lost money on the one hand and these unexpected expenses on the other left me in a helpless condition.
I could neither return nor go forward; I didn’t know what to do.
After long hesitation I decided to let you know of my difficulties.
I am ashamed to tell my story to anyone else. I have no one else to tell it to anyway.
The Armenians who come here are in a miserable condition.
Some come without any money, giving their sense of honor to the winds; some come depending upon the good will of some friend in America and wait for months, subjected to disgrace and disappointments; some have money, but have no knowledge of French and therefore are cheated out of every cent.
Now I myself share in their condition.
My dear old friend, I have only you to whom I may turn to help me out of this misery.
I never meant to be a burden to you.
Could you send me a ticket for America and enough money to satisfy the authorities?
The doctor of the steamship company assures me that my eyes will be cured in two weeks, so that by the time I hear from you I shall be in condition to travel.,
I am sure that better days will come after my arrival there and I shall be able to pay my debts.
I have both the strength and the will to work.
Waiting for your speedy answer, I am, Yours sincerely,
An Offer to Open an Account.
Messrs. Rawlins & Smith, Boston, Mass.
Gentlemen:
I have lately opened a hardware store in this place, and as I am not yet fully stocked, I propose opening an account with your house, if agreeable to you.
I refer you to Messrs. Jones & Ralph, of your city, with whom I have had dealings in the past, and also to Messrs. Matthews, Wilson & Co., of this city, who are well acquainted with my financial standing, and with whom I believe you correspond.
Should the information you may receive from them prove satisfactory, please inform me to that effect, and I will at once forward an order for what goods I require at present.
Very respectfully,
Application for an Office Boy’s Position.
I respectfully apply for the position advertised in the Herald of this morning.

Gentlemen:

Yours truly,
Asking Security in the Form of an Endorsed Note.
Gentlemen:
Your letter of July 1, giving an explanation for non-payment of our draft on you, has been received, but is not entirely satisfactory.
You were aware that the amount for which I drew on you was more than due, and I delayed remittances for some days, expecting to receive your check for the amount due me, until I feared that further delay would seriously compromise me.
The best way out of the difficulty would be for you to furnish me with a properly endorsed thirty days’ note, which I could apply to my present needs.
This would give you ample time to provide funds to meet the note.
I trust it will not embarrass you; but I shall expect you to adopt this course, the only one that I can suggest to avoid complications with Messrs. Alfred Smith & Co. I am

Final Letter to Collect a Bill.
Dear Sir:
I have written to you a number of times inclosing my bill against you for family supplies.
This bill is of long standing; nearly a year over due.
I have waited patiently for a settlement, or some evidence of a disposition on your part to reduce the indebtedness, at least, if you cannot pay it all at once.
Having extended to you in the matter as much courtesy as any reasonable person could expect, I must now finally insist upon an immediate settlement, in default of which, I shall place the claim in the hands of my attorney, with instructions to commence legal proceedings.
Trusting that you will not compel me to resort to measures so disagreeable, I am Very truly yours,
Accepting a Proposal for Arbitration.
Dear Sir:
We are willing to accept the proposal, mentioned in your letter of May 16, to settle our dispute by arbitration, and we have with that end in view sent copies of all the papers relative to the transaction to our friend, Mr. Robert Borden, of your city, whom we have authorized to act and decide for us.
Our intentions, of which he will advise you, we hereby confirm.
Yours very truly,
Asking the Opinion of a Friend About Coming to America.
Dear ...,
I want to ask your opinion in regard to an importaht question, and I am sure you will not refuse it.
Since the death of my father the support of the whole family has fallen upon me, and I have gladly undertaken to discharge this sacred duty.
Having no capital at hand I was obliged to sell our house and open a little store with the proceeds.
After the hard work of days and nights it began to yield a bare living, but for some time it has not brought even that.
Now my younger brother has graduated from school and has begun to work with me to learn the business.
After a little experience he will be able to manage the store by himself and make it his chief occupation.
And I am thinking of coming to America to work there in order that I may secure the future of the family and help my brother to enlarge his business.
After meditating upon the subject for weeks, I have decided to ask your opinion before taking any step.
Since you have been so many years in America and have gained acquaintance with the conditions of the country, I would ask you to write me soon your opinion of my plan.
I have at hand enough money for the expenses of the journey and I want to start before I spend it.
Mother and all join with me in sending you greetings. Mother always remembers you with pleasure.
Hoping to hear from you soon, I am, Yours truly,
The Answer.
Dear ...,
In your last letter you asked my opinion in regard to your intention of coming to America.
Here is my idea of the matter.
Although America enjoys the reputation of being a country of wealth and opportunity, it is not so in fact, at least, at the present time.
I am sure the reputation was not unfounded in the past, but things are different now.
There is wealth in the country and immense wealth, but it is not true that we can easily get a share of it.
Who among the immigrants is rich now? Or who has secured a well-to-do condition?
We work a little, for a few months, and save forty or fifty dollars; but suddenly business slackens and we are laid off for weeks, meanwhile spending all of our savings.
If we have sent home from ten to twenty dollars during the period of work, that is all our tangible gain.
It is not uncommon during a long period of lack of work for men to spend not only all their savings but also to incur heavy debts. Consequently they are subjected to years and years of labor to get rid of their debts.
Now the chances of success are few and incidental in this country.
Those who can earn a simple livelihood at home are in a more advantageous condition than those who work here for fifteen dollars a week.
There is another reason which prevents my consenting to your coming, namely, that this is the year of the presidential election.
During such a period business is apt to be bad, especially when the issue of the campaign is the revision of the tariff.
The financial condition of the country is too dependent upon the tariff; every change or program of change stops business and throws people into difficulties.
Things are palpably bad now, and there is fear that many will be left hungry from lack of work, and the government will be obliged to open free soup houses.
The conclusion is, that you should not budge this year, and we shall see how things will turn out next year. 
I hope my letter does not discourage you.
If you have coming here in your mind, you will come some day. There is plenty of time yet.
The Turkish motto yavash yavash (slowly) fits well in this case.
Keep up your courage and be patient.
Give my sincere thanks to your mother and tell her that I have not ceased loving her as I love my own mother.
Write me oftener.
With best wishes
Dear Mother,
Today is about a month before Christmas. I shall send you my best wishes at the proper time.
My voice does not reach you and a letter goes very slowly.
I send you this letter now to have you get ready for Christmas.
I enclose for you a check for three pounds in Father’s name, and I want you to make yourself a pretty dress to wear on Christmas day when you receive our relatives around the hearth fire at home.
I cannot be there, but I shall be present in spirit. I am sure that you will look just like a young bride in that dress, and that that day will be a day of happiness for the whole family.
I want also to have your photograph on my table.
You will make me very happy if you will send me a picture taken in your new dress.
Dear Father,
This is the first Christmas that I have spent away from you in a different country.
I see happy families around me who amuse themselves in their homes by singing, playing, dancing and laughing, and I remember the joyful reunions which we used to have with our relatives.
Our happiness was not like the happiness of these people free from worries; but, after all, the hours gave us some relaxation.
Now Uncle and I are alone in our room and we are getting ready to go to an Armenian meeting to hear some beloved songs and listen to some speeches.
But before leaving the room I want to withdraw for a few minutes into the memory of our previous Christmas reunions and in imagination to see you, Mother, Sister, Uncle, Aunt, etc., around the hearth fire and take part in your conversation.
I enjoy the sweetness of home in memory and feel happy.
I hope with all my heart that you may be blessed by many years and that upon our eeturn you may be able to see the whole family again around you.
Your grateful son,
The Mother’s Answer.
December 24, —.
My dear Son,
You may think tears were an ungracious welcome to give your good letter.
But they were not all tears of homesickness to see my boy. There were tears of joy, too; because you do not forget me, and, although you are having a hard struggle and earning only a little, you have planned to give me a new dress.
You may be sure that the finest dress could not make me as happy as your thought has made me.
By and by I shall send you my picture as you ask, although I had thought myself too old to have one taken.
We are all in good health and busy in the ways that you remember well. 
We miss you more than you can realize.
You have many new interests to take your time and thought. But we are living as we have lived for many years, except that you are gone.
Your father and I sit and talk of you in the evening.
We want you to do what is best for yourself. You will succeed after a time.
But we pray daily that in a strange land and in the midst of temptations you may be the same pure, true, and strong boy you were when at home— only stronger as you grow in years.
Write often and tell all about yourself — the little things as well as the big ones.
Have you found a good boarding house?
What do you do about your mending?
Today I made ————— for dinner.
We spoke of your liking for it and wished you could have enjoyed it with us.
With much love from us all and hoping to hear from you soon, Your loving mother,
Dear Brother,
I wish you could have seen Mother’s face when she opened and read your letter.
You would have felt more than repaid for any sacrifice your gift may have cost.
You know Mother’s way of attending to her own needs last, and will not be surprised to hear that she had no really good dress.
I am to have the honor of making the new dress, and you may be sure I shall do my best.
Thanks to your present and to my skill, Mother will look her prettiest at Christmas time.
With love for you always from us all, Your affectionate sister, Vartouhi.
A Humorous Letter.
Dear ...,
I wish you were with me and that we could have happy talks and laughs together.
Ten years ago you would run to me as soon as you put your shoes on. Why don’t you do it now?
You may say that it is too far and there is water between.
Let me tell you an Irish story which may give you a hint.
An Irishman, who was always working hard at his old home and yet could not make both ends meet, constantly heard that in America gold grew in the streets and on the trees.
He heard it repeated so often that he finally believed it and decided to go to that land of gold.
He sold everything he had, procured the money for the journey, and, boarding the first steamship, soon arrived at New York.
When he found himself in this new world without friends and money he became very much disheartened. He saw gold neither in the streets nor on the trees.
Sad and gloomy he stood on the beach hanging his head down and gazing over the endless waves. Presently a diver emerging from the water attracted his attention.
The poor simple-minded man began to scold himself and exclaimed: “How foolish I was! If I had only known that it was possible to walk under the water I would not have spent my money to take a steamship.”
Now, you may take your first breath at Marseilles: after that as far as Havre it is land. You may dive at Havre. The Goddess of Liberty in New York harbor will light your way with her torch; come to the light.
After drying your clothes at the beach, come directly to 50th Street, where you will find me.
Yours as ever,
A Letter About Amusement.
Dear ...,
The warm days of summer have already come.
We stop work at Saturday noon, so I have a chance to look around.
Boston is situated on the seashore, but all the winter I could not, rather, I had no chance to see the water.
During my journey when there was a big storm I wanted very much to watch the waves of the ocean. However, seasickness would not permit me that proud feeling which we, as human beings, entertain at the sight of the victories of civilization which bridle even the huge billows.
I had determined that after arriving at my destination I would go to the ocean during a storm and watch the wild view of the rolling waves.
I could not carry that plan into effect.
Now, instead, I enjoy, every Saturday afternoon and Sunday, the immense blue of the peaceful ocean, not only as a dreaming observer but also as a sporting swimmer.
There is a State Bath House at Revere Beach, which provides bathing suits and cells in which to undress.
Men and women go to their respective sections, put on their bathing suits and come into the open sea.
The sight is very interesting for more than one reason. There is nothing against modesty.
I myself have my share in that delightful amusement.
I take a bath in the ocean! I lose myself, not in the immensity of the sea — for the safety of which the government has provided — but in a multitude of swimmers of both sexes.
I know no one to address in order to give vent to my joyful feelings.
How I wish you were here with me so that we could enjoy such sport together and express ourselves to each other!
Yours as ever,
A Letter After Long Separation.
Dear Brother,
How long do you expect to stay in that faraway land?
We have stopped singing, “O, Where is my wandering boy tonight?”
You remember it was one of our favorites.
Father and Mother cannot stand it now.
We at home are not the only ones who are wondering how long the separation is to last.
Isabel is too modest to ask questions, but her eyes are often full of tears.
You haven’t forgotten her eyes, have you, Brother mine?
America must be a wonderful country.
I often think I would like to join you there if only all the family might go with me.
Perhaps, if you do not return within a few years, it may be possible for us to go.
Your friends Dikran and Mary are married and are near neighbors of ours.
Mary makes a good housekeeper and is an excellent cook.
Krikor Armaian died last week of tuberculosis.
His mother will have a hard time, for he was her only support.
Write often.
We want to hear all about you.
We always miss you.
With much love from us all, Your affectionate sister,
Complaining the Quality of Goods.
Dear Sir,
I am very sorry to be compelled to complain that the last bill of goods received from you is not equal to the samples sent.
I have never before had occasion to complain, and I am disposed to think there has been some mistake, which no doubt you will be ready to correct.
The goods you have sent are really of no use to me; I should harm my reputation by endeavoring to sell them to my customers at any price.
You will oblige me by giving immediate attention to this matter.
Yours truly,
A Letter from a Man Inviting His Sister to America.
Dear Father and Mother:
I send you enclosed a check for seventy English pounds, and I make you a proposition which you may accept if you think proper. If not, we will drop it.
My work is guaranteed. I can continue it for years without any danger of losing it. After this relief my mind ponders more upon my loneliness, which I cannot bear now.
My sister Eugenia is eighteen years old. Having already graduated from school, she is a young lady, interested in books and literature. Her letters show what a bright girl she is, and the more I read her old and new letters the more I miss her.
Therefore I am thinking of having her come here, especially now that my work is secure and I have to stay here for several years more.
Her coming will be good both for her and for me.
She will see a new country, her mental outlook will be enlarged and she may go to some school to continue her study, she may even specialize in some subject.
And the presence of a sister will not only dispel my loneliness, but will also encourage and stimulate me to live a better life and to seek a higher position.
My two younger brothers and other sister, Hripsime, will remain with you until either we return to join you or you come here to settle down with us. I do not entertain the latter idea, because we shall be happier at home if political and economical conditions are bettered.
But at present we must try to profit from the advantages that this country offers us. I am sure that Eugenia is bright enough to get the full benefit from American schools.
I shall help her not only as her brother but also as her debtor, as compensation for the happiness which she will confer upon me by her companionship.
I have no doubt that her absence will be a hardship for you, but the fact that she and I will be happy here will comfort you.
Besides, Hripsime will take the place of her sister with her liveliness and jolly disposition.
If there are not strong reasons to make her coming objectionable, and if you agree to this temporary division of the family, send her next spring.
I shall arrange everything to make her journey comfortable.
Thirty or thirty-five pounds out of this seventy is more than enough to travel in the second cabin.
Waiting for your answer, Your grateful son,
A Letter From a Man Without Work to His Father.
Dear Father,
In spite of my usual custom I nave not been able to send you any money for four months.
I suffer more on this account than for any other reason.
This is a very bad year financially in the United States. Many factories have either shut their doors or have reduced their working hours to one-half, or even less.
For three months I worked only two days in a week, and during these last two months there has been no work for me at all.
I know that you need money and I have wanted to send a small sum; but this lack of work not only has exhausted all my savings, it has forced me to incur heavy debts. Now all my friends and acquaintances either are without work or are working one-half day, so that I cannot borrow.
Even if they were working the whole day, no one is willing to lend in these uncertain times.
Then, dear Father, do not attribute this delay to my negligence. I have not ceased to love my parents. Every day I think of you and try to find some way to help, but without success.
They say that these hard days will not last very long. They have lasted long enough! Normal conditions are expected within two months.
I hope that this opinion is well founded.
As soon as I begin to work I shall make haste to send some money.
At present you may borrow money there to be paid back in three or four months, and then I will transmit to you the necessary sum.
I was never before left without work for so long.
I have wanted to learn another trade, but I have had neither the money to pay the expense nor any chance.
Hoping that you will forgive me for this involuntary delay, and that you will find some way to get through these hard times, I remain, Your grateful son,
Father’s Answer.
My dear child,
Your letter filled us with sorrow, not because you could not help us in our hard circumstances, but because you have been suffering in a foreign country, away from the comfort of home.
Dear boy, the fact that you think of us even in the midst of such hardships shows your great love for your parents.
Your father was not fortunate enough to put himself in a position where he could live without your help.
But whatever our situation may be we do not want you to worry about us.
We shall do something here.
Our supplies can carry us through several months, and we may secure a little money for small expenses by selling our old copper utensils, which we never use.
At the worst, we can sell the house.
Now then, my boy, take good care of yourself and do not worry about us.
We do not have much to expect in this world. Our days have passed. Our only desire is for your success, prosperity, and happiness.
Praying that Heaven may assist you and bless you, Your father,

A Letter of Lord Byron’s.
My dearest Caroline:
If the tears, which you saw, and know I am not apt to shed; if the agitation in which I parted from you, agitation which you must have perceived through the whole of this nervous affair, did not commence till the moment of leaving you approached; if all I have said and done, and am still but too ready to say and do, have not sufficiently proved what my feelings are, and must ever be, towards you, my love, I have no other proof to offer.
God knows I never knew till this moment the madness of my dear dearest and most beloved friend.
I cannot express myself, this is no time for words, but I shall have a pride, a melancholy pleasure, in suffering what you yourself can scarcely conceive, for you do not know me.
I am about to go out with a heavy heart, for my appearing this evening will stop any absurd story to which the events of the day might give rise.
Do you think now I am cold and stern and wilful?
Will ever others think so?
Will your mother ever? The mother to whom we must indeed sacrifice much more, much more on my part than she shall ever know, or can imagine.
“Promise not to love you?”
Ah, Caroline, it is past promising!
But I shall attribute all concessions to the proper motive, and never cease to feel all that you have already witnessed, and more than ever can be known, but to my own heart, perhaps to yours.
May God forgive, protect, and bless you ever and ever, more than ever.
Your most attached Byron.
P. S. These taunts have driven you to this, my dearest Caroline, and were it not for your mother, and the kindness of your connections, is there anything in heaven or earth that would have made me so happy as to have made you mine long ago?
And not less now than then, but more than ever AT THIS TIME.
God knows I wish you happy, and when I quit you, or rather you, from a sense of duty to your mother, quit me, you shall acknowledge the truth of what I again promise and vow, that no other, in word or deed, shall ever hold the place in my affections which is and shall be sacred to you till I am nothing.
You know I would with pleasure give up all here or beyond the grave for you, and in refraining from this must my motives be misunderstood?
I care not who knows this, what use is made of it, it is to you and to you only, yourself.
I was, and am yours, freely and entirely, to obey, to honor, love, and fly with you, when, where, and how yourself might and may determine,
A Lover’s Quarrel.
It is with pain I write to you in aught that can seem like a strain of reproach, but I confess that your conduct last night both surprised and vexed me.
Your marked approbation of the attentions paid to you by —— was as obvious as your neglect of myself. 
Believe me, I am in no way given to idle jealousy; still less am I selfish or unmanly enough to wish to deprive a girl on whom I have so firmly fixed my affections of any pleasure to be obtained in good society.
But my peace of mind would be lost forever did I believe that I have lost one atom of your affection.
Pray write, and assure me that you still preserve your undivided affection for
Your devoted but grieved,
A Newcomer Asks an Old Friend for Suggestions.
Dear ...,
For a week I have made myself an inhabitant of this new world.
At present I live in Chelsea.
I have already rested from the fatigue of the journey and am thinking of a job.
I wish you were near and that we could see each other.
How are you and what is your occupation in Chicago?
Now we are comparatively near each other, and I hope that some day we may meet.
I am not yet acquainted with the conditions and customs of this country. Suggestions out of your experience will be useful to me and will guide me into the right path.
Therefore I want to hear from you as soon as possible.
Shaking your hands, I am, Yours truly,
Answer with Suggestions.
Dear Panos,
I was glad to receive your letter informing me of your arrival in America. I congratulate you and send my best wishes.
You say that you have already begun to worry about work. I know what a vexing question it is for a newcomer; but you must not lose your courage, because finding employment is not an impossible problem after all.
I wish I could help you directly and immediately.
You asked for suggestions. I am afraid I cannot make any which will be new to you or of any value; but in order to say something I want to mention the following simple and well-known points.
I have no doubt that you will make applications personally or by letters to get employment.
Do not make any personal application without dressing well, without shaving neatly, and without a good supply of self-reliance and courage.
Of course a good suit does not represent a man’s worth, but there is no way of immediately measuring the merit of people. Good clothes give an impression in regard to the neatness and good taste of the wearer, and therefore we must secure their services.
Negligence in shaving would mean a lack of neatness, which we must avoid.
If we wish to see some one today, yesterday’s shaving will not do; today we must shave again.
Negligence in this matter not only gives an impression of carelessness, but also means an absence of respect toward the man whom we visit.
Above all, America is a free country, and if a man fails to show a spirit of courage within the limits of self-respect it will seem strange.
Cowardliness and discouragement are signs of weakness, and unfortunately the weak do not have respect anywhere.
The general feeling of men toward the weak is a feeling of annoyance. This is to be regretted, but it is a fact witnessed even among ourselves.
Sometimes involuntary idleness depresses a man and then all good words seem to him air bubbles; and yet depression is defeat and no one cares for the defeated.
When asked for a job the boss may happen to feel out of sorts and nervous; that must not discourage us.
It is everybody’s inviolable right to demand an opportunity to work. Remember that the same man would be more than glad to see you, if he were in need of men; and men will always be needed.
It is not out of kindness alone that Americans admit us to this country. They admit us because they want our labor, and if they do not need it today, they will need it tomorrow.
If they give us a chance to work we shall be thankful, but we shall not humiliate ourselves.
For this very reason we shall not beg or implore.
Imploring pleases only the petty little tyrants of Asia.
It means an absence of self-respect; and if a man fails to respect himself, others cannot respect him.
Even petitions to the President of the United States should contain no supplication.
Sometimes men go from one exaggeration to another.
Because courage often leads to success, thoughtless people come to the conclusion that “Bluff” is the only means of getting along.
Bluff has its place here as in every other country, perhaps a little more in this country than in others. But bluffing must not be carried to bragging.
It causes the ruin of a good many.
In order to make a successful bluff we must appreciate our ability; instead of underestimating our powers we may overestimate them a little, which will do us good and give us the inspiration of self-confidence.
When we make a written application, we must do it in a plain and short letter, without supplication and without mentioning our difficulties or misfortunes.
We are not given a job for the sake of pity.
We must mention our ability and not our weaknesses or shortcomings. Everybody is supposed to have some kind of weakness, and we are not obliged to give an account of our own.
We must show self-reliance and confidence in our power of doing things, as long as we have not proofs to the contrary.
It is easy to say such things and I do not know how much I can practice them myself.
As I told you before, I write these just for the sake of writing, and I know that you know as much as I do.
Yours truly,
A New Year’s Letter.
Dear ...,
This is New Year’s evening. Sitting alone in my room I am thinking of my past life.
I remember the days of my childhood, the happy hours that we spent together playing and amusing ourselves.
All those walks, merry jokes, and talks, even the little games which we invented with our childhood’s imagination come back to me now.
What happy days they were, which we could not appreciate.
How different life is now, the life of intense struggle for a little bread.
It would not seem to me so gloomy if I had the assurance of success in my pursuit of some cherished ideals.
At this hour of rest, when the mystic moment brings back to me those delightful days of the past, I feel a strong desire to return to that life and find again my childhood and the chum of my childhood.
In this mood I find happiness in writing to you.
I hope the New Year begins with brighter prospects for you and will bring a new store of happy days.
Give my best wishes and greetings to every member of the family and tell all of them that I have not forgotten them, and that I am, in heart and spirit, the same person, although time and space have separated us.
A Passionate Declaration from a Young Man
The sentiments you have given birth to, in my heart, by those graces which make you seem in my eyes a divine being, are of such a nature that I seek in vain for adequate expressions to depict them.
Since I have had the happiness of seeing you, the words I would speak to you die upon my lips.
When you speak the sound of your voice vibrates to the depths of my soul, and so, when I admire the charms with which nature has endowed you, a secret sorrow agitates my senses, and I know not where I am.
When you are absent the place you have embellished seems desolate, and that which had seemed a paradise with you is changed into a frightful desert.
However, love, to console me, gives me often in my dreams the joy of seeing you, and the rapture of pressing you to my heart.
But it is to the reality of these pleasures that my soul aspires.
When, O best beloved, shall I enjoy such happiness? Answer me.
Your devoted admirer,
A RESOLUTION OF PROTEST
Having hailed the restoration of the Ottoman Constitution, we, the Armenians of Boston and vicinity, shocked by recent massacres in Cilicia and by the indifference shown by the Ottoman Government and, after long expectations, bitterly disappointed by the belated “justice”, assembled in mass meeting, August 15, 1909, protest emphatically against the accusations of separatism attributed to the Armenians as a new means of persecution and condemn the injustice of the martial court of Adana, which failed to punish the real authors of the crime.
We also express our indignation at the execution of the six Armenians who were made the scapegoats and of the nine Turks who were but blind tools.
As citizens of the Ottoman Empire we demand that an end be put to the persecution of the Armenians of Cilicia and that severe punishment be visited on the real criminals, whose escape from punishment is an irony of constitutional law and justice.
A Sister’s Letter to Her Far-Away Brother.
Dear Brother:
I want to write you every day, but months pass and I cannot find time to concentrate my mind upon writing.
When I was a girl at home I had plenty of time to write, but now I am the mother of three children and very much occupied.
If I delay my letters, you must not think that I have forgotten you or have ceased to love you.
I not only have not forgotten you but I have taught my children to love their distant uncle.
Sarkis often talks about you and says, “When Uncle comes I'll be big and go to school”. Zabel has already begun to go to school and she wants to learn how to write in order to send a letter to her “Uncle in America”.
My dear, Father died longing for you and Mother is spending the days of her old age in tears which fill our hearts with sorrow.
Why do you stay so long in that country?
It is not given to every man to find a fortune in America.
You have been one of the great number of people for whom fortune has no smiles. Come and comfort Mother’s last days and make us happy.
Your brother-in-law joins me in asking for your return home. He has a little business. You may work together and enlarge it.
Our Uncle and Aunts are all growing old and wish very much to see you before they die.
I suppose, Brother, you remember how they loved us. As long as I see them I think I am still a little girl; they give the same care and caresses.
Come and enjoy their love, and I am sure you will feel as in the old days. Youth will come back to you.
For some time you have not written either.
When you delay your letters Mother is sadly afflicted. She opens your case, kisses your books and old letters, and sheds tears, reading them over and over again.
I can never believe that your heart is getting hardened.
Come, Brother, do not delay any longer. You can earn your bread here just as well as there.
I know, dear Brother, you will not be able to bring wealth, but you will bring to all our relatives a bright smile, sunshine, and happiness, which are valued more than any wealth in the world.
You do not know what tears will be dried.
Do not stay any longer. Come to your loving kinsfolk.
Your waiting sister, Zemroukhd.
The Brother’s Answer.
Dear Sister,
I can find no words to express the pleasure which I felt when I received your long-waited-for letter.
Being among your loved ones in your own dear home you cannot imagine what great comfort a letter from beloved ones brings to a vagabond like myself.
To me, especially, your letters bring the sunshine of a spring morning.
You say that your delay in writing is not due to negligence or forgetfulness, but to the condition of a very busy mother.
My dear, I have never thought that you could be negligent or that you could forget me.
I know how your days pass. The children keep you busy at home; every day they bring change, sometimes happiness, sometimes worry. Thus weeks and months go by, and suddenly you realize that you have not written to your brother. Perhaps, having delayed so long, you wait for a new letter.
Nothing is left for me in the world except my dear ones in the faraway home.
Oh, if you only knew how much I miss you!
I dearly love my mother, who is getting old; I love my sister, who teaches my name to her children and sends me their words of love; I love my nephews and niece, who love their unknown uncle with the tender feelings of childhood; I love my uncle and my aunts, who, inspite of my wandering so long in a distant land, have not ceased making me an object of their tender care and love.
My dear, I myself long to return and enjoy our dear home with the old folks and the youngsters; I don’t know how to explain. I came here for a purpose. I had nurtured bright hopes in the precious days of my ambitious youth.
Now all is gone; none of my cherished objects are won.
I am now farther from my goal than when I came to this country.
If my dear uncle had lived I would have had a different fortune. How can I return in this condition? What can I bring to you?
Although I am defeated in every particular, I have not lost my pride and a man’s self-respect.
No, my dear sister, I cannot return so poor. In this condition I would be more of a worry to my dear old mother than a comfort.
Encourage her and assure her that her love will remain my best wealth.
I have already given up my castles in the air. After this I shall concentrate my efforts upon getting ready to return, and make such preparation that I shall not be ashamed to look the world in the face.
I do not know how long it will take, I must work at least three years longer.
I am confident that mother will wait bravely through these three years and that we shall meet again before death.
Dear Sister, the pleasure of hearing from you on the one hand and the sad lines in your letter on the other have aroused such emotion that my mind is confused.
My intention was to write a good letter, but I find that my letter is entirely different from what I wanted it to be.
I thought of tearing it up, but, not feeling disposed to write a better one, I send it, in order that there may be no delay and that I may hear from you again as soon as possible.
Your brother,
A Useful Proposition.
Dear Aram,
It is my ambition to remain a true Armenian and yet to become a good citizen of the United States.
I love our language with the warm heart of an Armenian, and I like to learn English for its own sake and as my first duty of citizenship.
I shall henceforth write to you in English and I want you to answer me in the same language. It will be good practice for both of us.
You have learned it in regular schools, and I have learned it in the school of life, picking up a little in factories, a little in the evening schools, and a little in churches.
English is a source of power and a means of success.
Being a workingman I lack facilities for improving my knowledge of it and gaining a command of good style; but I have decided to welcome any opportunity which may help me to attain my desired object.
Therefore my correspondence with you will be not only a great pleasure to me but also a means of self-education.
Let this letter be the first attempt of
Yours truly, Diran Hovsepian.
LOVE LETTERS.
A Young Man Desiring to Cultivate Friendship with a Young Lady.
Dear Miss,
Will you kindly allow this liberty from an unknown person who, with a deep sense of respect, desires to cultivate acquaintance with you?
My long intimacy with your uncle as a chum and the few notes that I have had the pleasure of exchanging with your father give me the flattering idea that my name is not altogether new to you.
My dear lady, not knowing the life of our people in this faraway land, you cannot help thinking this attempt upon my part a strange affair.
I was left an orphan early in life and do not know a mother’s care or a sister’s love.
I can imagine how happy I would be if the mail brought me regularly letters from mother or sister, and I, in reply, could put down on paper the best of my thoughts and the most tender sentiments that move me.
I have the longing, but I have no way of expressing myself.
I am conscious of the empty place in my heart which a mother or sister could fill.
I have often heard your uncle speak of your good character and bright intellect, and your photograph in his room gives me the same idea of you.
Therefore the desire of gaining your acquaintance has grown more and more irresistible within me until now, yielding to that desire, I write to you.
I confess that this is the first letter that I have ever written to a young lady, and I feel that it is one of the best privileges of life.
The vacant space in my life will be filled by cultivating such a friendship as this.
Perhaps this liberty is more bold than I realize, but I hope you will pardon it, being assured of my best intentions.
Please, dear lady, accept assurances of the highest respect of Yours very sincerely,
The Answer.
Karin, Nov. 5, 19—.
Dear Sir,
Your letter of October 6 reached me about a week ago.
I had seen your name mentioned in my uncle’s letters.
The fact that my uncle has found in you a highly appreciated friend is a proof to me of your kind nature and upright character.
I consider your letter an honor and I sincerely thank you for the same.
If correspondence with me has any value or may be useful to you in even a slight degree I do not wish to refuse such a small service.
Only, as an inexperienced girl, I have asked the opinion of my parents, who do not think a correspondence of this nature objectionable, especially since my uncle had recommended you so highly.
Unfortunately I am neither a good writer nor an observer; it seems to me that there is nothing interesting in our town to write about. There may be something, but I fail to see it.
Perhaps I have no aptitude for observation. Even if I have, I have no opportunity to develop it, on account of the very limited environment destined for Armenian girls.
You may have many things in that wonderful country to see, to hear and to read about, and, therefore, many interesting things of which to write.
I send this letter enclosed in the letter I send to my uncle.
I have written him some home news, which you may learn from him if you are interested in such trifles.
Wishing you success, I am, dear sir, Yours respectfully,
After Exchanging a Few Letters, the Young Man Writes of Love.
Dear Miss ...,
Will you permit me this time to obey the dictates of my heart and to write you in words which spring from the depths of my being, words which I can no longer restrain?
My dear, I woke up early this morning to read your letter once more in the sweet morning’s light.
The sky is now clear and brilliant, and the glowing sun, unusual in the rainy month of April, rises and spreads cheer and happiness.
But your letter has a more penetrating ray for my heart.
Do you blame me for this sudden change in the style of my letters? Or do you think it is too soon?
When love speaks other rules vanish.
My heart is so full that I can give no vent to my feelings in these few minutes. I want to tell you only that my future is in your hands and that my chief desire is to devote myself to your happiness.
The whistles are blowing. The sound of steam calls me to work. I must end my letter; but, my dear, believe me, my love for you will never end.
Waiting for your answer, I am, Yours devotedly,
The Answer. 
Dear Mr. ...,
The change of tone in your last letter was so sudden that I feel it impossible for me to write anything.
I have no doubt of your sincerity, and I wish you happiness with all my heart, but I am not sure that I can make you happy.
The question is a serious one. We do not know each other. You may not find your ideal in me.
Pardon me for this natural inability to write any further.
I hope I have not occasioned you suffering in any way. 
With best wishes, Yours sincerely,
The Young Man Invites the Young Woman to Visit America. :
Dear Miss ...,
When sentiments are strong words are too weak to express them. I cannot describe the happiness and suffering that I felt after reading your last letter.
I am confident that I shall find in you all the qualities which I admire. In that respect I am ready to take any “risk.”
But I admit that I was not sufficiently known to you to make a love proposal.
Therefore, in the name of our sincere friendship and by the kind permission of your uncle, I send you as a present a check for forty pounds, to be used by you for the expenses of a visit to America. Here, under the protection of your uncle, you may study your new environment and the character of the one who is your devoted admirer.
I hope you will not refuse this request of mine.
Your freedom will under no circumstances be impaired.
In case you cannot find your ideal in me, my only wish will be your happiness and a small place in your friendship.
Your uncle also will write to you and make arrangements to welcome you.
Yours truly,
Breaking a Long Silence.
Dear Zaven:
I have not written to you for three whole years.
You remember that when I first came to America I wrote you oftener, and lengthy letters.
The novelty of the new world supplied me with unlimited material, and I had a strong desire to communicate to you all the things which attracted my attention in this continent—altogether different from our own.
But life is full of deep distress, which must be faced by most of the foreigners who subject themselves to the vicissitudes of fortune to earn a livelihood, or to satisfy their adventurous instincts, or to find freedom to pursue their cherished ideals.
Have you read the El-dorado of Edgar Allen Poe, a pretty poem in which a gallant knight is described as growing old in search of a land of fabulous wealth?
Many knights, searchers for moral or material wealth, come to this country, and fall into a current; some are lost, and others who survive their difficulties feel the shadow of old age in their hearts.
For three years such a current carried me, throwing me from one city to another, from one factory to another, from idleness to the disappointments of underpaid drudgery. I was almost lost; I had neither heart nor peaceful mind to write.
If I am not mistaken I answered your last letter by a card, expressing my hope of writing a long letter soon. But now I realize that three years have elapsed since that time.
When I wrote that card I had already fallen into that unsettled life, but I had hopes for better days, which have not dawned until now.
I do not feel equal to going into details. I have so many things to say that I do not know how to begin or how to end.
For the last two days I have been trying to concentrate my mind upon my three years’ life in order to tell you of it, but I cannot find my way through.
I am confident that my mind will take its normal course and, by the time I receive the answer to this letter, I shall be able to write about all my past experiences.
I write this letter just to tell you that I have not forgotten you, the memory of the good old days has not gone, and that I want to put away from me these bitter feelings of hardship and enjoy the sweet memory of our boyhood.
At present let me inform you that I have been working for the last two weeks as a bookkeeper in the office of a great iron foundry.
They like my work and I hope I shall get better pay very soon.
I shall continue attending evening schools to learn mechanical engineering.
Write me a long letter; I am sure that your mind is brighter and more capable of writing all that you have done in these last three years.
How are you now and what are you doing?
Write every detail; I can assure you that I shall read with great pleasure details that may seem most insignificant to you.
I myself promise to write a very long letter.
It seems to me that I shall not be able to write any description until I hear from you.
I am so hungry for home news that I shall relish even gossip.
The Answer.
My dear Setrak:
Your letter of October 5th was a pleasant surprise both to me and to all our family.
We had talked about you frequently and wondered that we did not hear from you.
I had even kept your last card; after receiving your letter I found it, bearing neither date nor address. It was evident from the post office stamp that it was sent from Boston.
Many times, after long waiting and failing to obtain the letter alluded to, I wanted to write you, but I had no address.
I could not use the old one, because you had written that you were about to leave Boston.
Although you were silent for so long I never lost my hope of hearing from you.
I knew that you were struggling under unfavorable circumstances in the new world, and I was confident that you would not lose your vigor and your courage, and that in the end you would secure a position which would enable you to pursue your ideals.
The more you delayed writing the more certain I was of the intensity of the struggle.
Yesterday when I received your letter my joy was great, and I was so impatient to impart the news to the folks that I ran home quickly. We celebrated the day with delight.
Had your people been in the city without doubt we would have had a dinner party.
About a year ago your father was in the city. He spent a couple of days with us. Most of the time we talked about you.
He did not know your address himself, because you had informed him by cards that you had no permanent address.
Doubtless by this time you must have written to him as well.
If I know of any one going to the country I will send the news by him.
Although your letter was a surprise and it gave us joy, it was not long enough to satisfy us. I read it and reread. It does not take more than a minute or two. Now I hasten to write this letter to enjoy the pleasure of writing to you, of which I was deprived for so long, and to obtain from you that promised answer as quickly as possible.
I appreciate your writing right after finding permanent work. You know how glad we all are to hear of your success.
I thank you for the joy you gave us.
But Father and Mother join me in complaining that you failed to communicate with us about your hard condition.
I know that we could not help you, but our words of sympathy and love might have given you some comfort in your discouraging circumstances.
I am aware that there are times when a fellow does not feel disposed to listen to powerless words; nevertheless, you ought to keep us well informed about your condition.
Now, of course, you expect some news from me.
I am sure that you read the papers in regard to our political situation.
Financial conditions are rather going backward. But, thanks to hard work, Father and I keep the family alive.
I am continuing my previous work.
If the family did not depend upon me I would like to try my fortune in the Yankee World myself, but there is no use of talking about that.
The city is in the same condition. A house is seldom built.
Two years ago a big fire destroyed the downtown market until four months ago part of the ruins were left abandoned because the owners could not have them rebuilt.
Some of them sold the ground to those who could afford to build new stores; but the new ones have hardly any advantage over the old.
The street there was broadened a little.
The schools are the same as ever. The new director is an able man, liked by people in general.
Last year there was considerable discord among the teachers. The reason was again Mr. M., who can’t agree with anybody.
This year he is in a different profession and the school is in peace.
In celebration of New Year a drama was played by the school boys in the school building, which was fairly successful.
Our Setrak was among the actors. He played the role of a prodigal son very well.
Although he was prodigal in his role, he is good in school and at home.
The bright son of Melkonentz is his strong competitor, who often snatches the first place from him.
Generally the two are equal in the class.
In the play Melkonian successfully represented the part of an old merchant.
There are only six of our classmates in the city: Hagopian is a teacher, Husnian helps his father, Sarkis is bookkeeper in the firm of Mateosian, and the Vautzian brothers have opened a hardware store and are doing pretty well.
Among these only Husnian is married, almost a year and a half now.
You knew his love affair. His father opposed the marriage for a long time, but finally yielded.
The couple are now the parents of a boy of nearly seven months.
The relations of the two families are agreeable at present.
Little Souren began to go to school this year. If we had a kindergarten we would have sent him last year.
Now he knows the alphabet.
Let me tell you now how we spent last evening at home.
Mother prepared for supper the dishes which you like. My sister, Nevart, framed your picture with pink ribbons, as if it were your birthday celebration.
Setrak has learned to play on the violin, and after supper he played the songs which you like best.
I don’t know whether Souren can really recollect you, because he was only two and a half years old when you left.
But he knows your picture and I say your name when I show it.
That is all for now.
With best wishes from us all, I am, Yours as ever, ZAVEN MARGOSIAN
Choice of Employment.
Dear Madam:
The request you make for my advice concerning your son’s future employment is a very flattering one, and I wish I were more capable of answering it.
As no man can do work well that he does not do with all his heart, let me ask, has your son business or professional tastes? If he wishes to be a lawyer or physician, do not try to make a merchant of him.
From your letter I take it that he has a taste for trade; if so, give him the opportunity he desires, and he will be, I trust, a credit to you.
If he were a little younger, he should begin as office boy, no matter what business he chooses.
In this way he would learn all the details of business life, and by close observation and attention, discover many things that would be of great advantage to him later in his career.
As he is too old for this, let him take a clerkship for a year or more, even if you have money to start him in business, as it is well for a man to serve a good house until he has made himself thoroughly acquainted with all the details of the business.
He makes many friends in this way, and becomes acquainted with the best systems and most advantageous localities, and learns in his own clerkship the qualities necessary to a successful merchant.
In selecting a business in which to place your son, you must be guided by the opportunities at hand.
In general, a wholesale house is to be preferred to a retail establishment, and one dealing in staple commodities to one dependent on the whims or fashions of the day.
Locality, capital, and prospect of advancement must also be carefully considered.
To you, immediate salary should be a matter of indifference.
When started in business for himself, let your son observe these principles:
Politeness to customers,
Prompt delivery of goods,
Goods sold for what they are.
Fixed prices.
Cash dealings when practicable.
Short credit, both in buying and selling.
Politeness, but firmness, in collecting accounts.
Following these rules of action, and bearing in mind that truthfulness, promptness, and politeness are three of the most necessary qualities required for any business, your son may in time attain the highest mercantile success.
Hoping most heartily that such will prove the case, I remain Respectfully yours,
Complaining of High Prices.
Dear Sir:
Your letter of May 2 is received, inclosing invoice and bill of lading of goods shipped to us by the Merchants’ Dispatch on April 28.
On comparing the prices with those charged us in invoice of Jan. 18, we note an advance of ½ cent on all the silks and woolens, and, as our orders called for the same patterns and qualities as before, we infer that there has been an error in making out our invoice.
Our trade is composed principally of foreigners and their families who come to town to make their purchases, and they represent a class of buyers who are always wide awake to their own interests.
A trifling rise in prices is liable to cause the loss of a portion if not all of their patronage; and, as we have to compete with other firms in this town, we are compelled to mark our goods down to the lowest figures practicable.
As the goods will not arrive for some time we hope that you will have rectified any error you find in our invoice, so that we can offer the goods referred to at the same prices at which we are now selling them.
Very truly yours,
Complaint about the Quality of Goods.
Gentlemen:
We regret the necessity which compels us to complain of the last invoice of goods received from your house.
Many of the articles are far below standard quality and samples from which we ordered.
The rubber goods are totally useless, having deteriorated from age, and to offer such goods to our trade would do us irreparable injury.
We hold the goods subject to your order and would thank you to give the matter prompt attention.
Yours truly,
Declining to Receive Goods.
Dear Sir:
I have just received notice of the arrival of the goods I ordered Feb. 18, but their failure to arrive in proper time has deprived me of the opportunity of selling them, as my customers have all been supplied with such goods by a rival concern; consequently, I have not only lost the sale of the goods, but probably some of my customers as well.
As I have no use for the goods this season, and cannot consistently hold them over until next winter, I am compelled to decline to receive them.
Very truly yours,
A Merchant Complaining of a Mistake in Shipment.
Gentlemen:
In reply to your letter of May 1, I would say that we are surprised to find that the case of hammers of your manufacture which we ordered on April 24 to be forwarded by express, has been shipped by freight.
These goods are out of our line, as you may be aware, and were ordered by us only to accommodate a customer whose goods we are shipping by steamer today.
They would have been here by yesterday at latest, in ample time to go with the other goods, if you had forwarded them as ordered.
As they have not come in time, we shall have no use for them, and therefore cannot accept them.
Yours truly,
Acknowledging Receipt of Goods.
Gentlemen:
The goods as per invoice of April 18 arrived yesterday in excellent condition, and they are satisfactory in every respect.
We thank you for the good judgment you used in selecting the goods, which indicate a very clear understanding of the styles and patterns suitable for our market.
We thank you for what you have done, and feel confident that you will continue in the future to exercise the same care and discrimination in the way of selection and packing.
Yours truly,

Yours truly,
Complaining of Not Receiving a Letter.
Although temporarily estranged from the delights of your society, I cannot refrain from hoping that you will enable me to realize some slender happiness from a more frequent correspondence on your part.
Four days have passed without my receiving a letter from you, and I am in painful anxiety lest illness should be the cause.
Pray write quickly, or I shall really feel inclined to quarrel with you as an idle girl; nay, I shall absolutely grow jealous, and fancy that some more favored suitor is undermining the affections of my dear girl.
But I have no fears.
I know too well that your innate goodness of heart would prevent you from trifling with the feelings of any one; so, hoping you will take this little scolding in good part, and relieve the offence by a very long letter as speedily as your fingers can write it, believe me, dear ——--, 
Complaint—A Delay in Goods.
Dear Sir:
On December 16 I sent you an urgent letter, ordering in haste the inclosed list of articles, which up to date I have not received; neither have you advised me of the reason for delaying shipment.
This delay has annoyed me greatly, necessitating the purchase in the market from time to time of such articles in the list as I needed, at advanced figures, which were redisposed of at cost rather than disappoint my customers.
This treatment is not that of my usual experience with you, and I desire an explanation.
If the goods are not here by January 26, you will please consider the order cancelled.
Yours respectfully,
Complaint—Inferior Goods.
Gentlemen:
We are reluctantly compelled to express our surprise and disappointment at finding the goods contained in your last shipment so unsatisfactory.
Upon examination we discover them to be so inferior that we are disinclined to offer them to our customers.
This causes annoyance, and, at this busy time, great inconvenience.
Although our confidence in your house remains unshaken by this last transaction, we are, notwithstanding, under the necessity of notifying you, that unless you can replace the invoice with goods of a superior class, we must cease all correspondence for the future.
Asking for an immediate reply, and, in the meantime, holding the goods subject to your order, we remain, gentlemen,
Respectfully yours,
Explaining an Apparent Slight.
My dearest Edna,
I am much grieved that you should think me capable of wavering in my affection toward you or wilfully inflicting a slight upon one in whom my whole hope of earthly happiness is centered.
Believe me, my attentions to Miss Bowen were never intended for anything more than common courtesy.
My long and intimate acquaintance with her brother, and my knowledge of her amiable character, as well as the circumstance of her being a comparative stranger to the Greens, were my sole reasons for paying more attention to her than I might otherwise have done.
Pray rest confident in the belief that my affection for you is as unchanging as my regret is great that I should ever have given you cause to doubt it, and believe me, dearest Edna, Yours, ever sincerely and devotedly,
LETTERS OF ADVICE.
From a Father.
My dear boy,
You are already settled in America.
In my previous letter I described our joy at the news of your safe arrival.
Today I write to discharge another parental duty, namely, to give moral strength and firmness to my distant son.
You had a strong desire to go to America. Your mother and I yielded to it, because we loved you and we thought of your future, and we had confidence in the firmness of your character, in your good conduct and healthy constitution.
Your journey to your present location was somewhat hazardous.
You arrived without any misfortune. We were all glad for that.
But you must remember that America is not your goal.
You only hope to find in America some means to win your cherished object; and in order to reach that you will have a longer and more dangerous journey.
The dangers of travel on sea or on land are independent of our will. The victims of such journeys inspire sympathy and grief, but the victims of moral journeys are subjected to scorn and ridicule. Although you are strong both in body and in spirit, temptations are strong, too.
Men must never place absolute confidence in their own strength; weakness often creeps in without our realization, and, if we are not careful, some day we may find ourselves captured.
My dear child, you are a lonely foreigner there; loneliness weighs heavily upon you and in that condition you may be easily lured by false smiles.
I have often heard that bad women do take advantage of this weakness of immigrants, and soon prevail upon their hearts, minds, and pockets.
Such a fall moves nobody’s pity.
Therefore, my boy, have the firmness of a manly man and remember always that the name of our family was left to us clean. Do not allow yourself any weakness that may bring a stain.
The honor that we enjoy in the circle where we are known was won by our forefathers through the sacrifices of years, of which, I am sure, you are as proud as I am.
It is our only wealth in this world, which we must know how to appreciate.
Then let that noble pride of family be your shield against all kinds of temptations, and some day, after reaching your goal, you may return to your parents bringing them happiness in their old age, not by gold, but by a noble character and untarnished honor.
My dear boy, with my limited knowledge I cannot advise you in other ways, but I feel confident that with wisdom you will choose the right way.
Expressing my full confidence in you and embracing you, I am, Your own father,
Proposing a Day for the Nuptials.
My dear ...,
The happy day to which I have looked forward as the blissful reward of our mutual constancy is not far distant, if the proposal I am now about to make should meet the approbation of yourself and parents. It is this: that our nuptial ceremony may be performed on the ——— of the present month, and in the parish church of ——.
I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you soon; we can then give the subject a lengthened discussion; if, however, you should wish to write before we meet, please mention whether the day I have fixed will suit the convenience of yourself and family.
Hoping that I may claim shortly the privilege of signing myself your affectionate husband, I am, Your sincerest friend,
Declaring His Love.
My dear Miss ...,
Ever since the day I was introduced to you my mind has been so filled with the one idea of yourself, and my whole soul so absorbed by the passion of love, that my thoughts have been completely distracted from my daily pursuits.
Doubt, fear, delight, and a thousand other emotions have successively agitated me, and all my efforts to suppress or stifle these feelings have been vain.
Being no longer able to resist their impulse, I crave your pardon for the liberty I take in addressing you.
My dear Miss —————, you alone  are the cause of my unhappiness, and must become the arbiter of my fate, for I shall be the happiest or most miserable of beings according as you reciprocate or reject my love.
But I cannot entertain the sad foreboding that a heart of so much tenderness and purity as yours will ever consign my prospects of future felicity to utter annihilation.
Oh, how ardently do I long for one sentence to calm my troubled mind; and it is in your power, my dear, to give the magic utterance.
Bestow but a slender ray of hope, and it will relieve me from a state of inexpressible anxiety; if you do not love me, say at least that you do not hate me.
Anxiously and impatiently shall I look for your reply, and, trusting you will excuse this rhapsody, for I am in such a state that I can scarcely form one sane reflection, I remain, my dear Miss ...., Your faithful and devoted lover,
A Favorable Reply.
Dear Sir:
I was not a little surprised at the tenor of your letter yesterday, and, while I am deeply sensible of the ardor and earnestness of your passion, I think your acquaintance with me is so slight that it is possible a closer intimacy might produce an alteration or modification of your sentiments.
Be that as it may, however, I give you credit for honor and sincerity in the too flattering complement given by the declaration of your feelings; and as your attentions on the evening we first met have left a not unpleasing impression on me, there will, so far as my own wishes are concerned, be no obstacles thrown in the way of a more familiar intercourse.
I mention this with the reservation that my guardians approve of our meeting in society. As I propose taking an early opportunity of acquainting my mamma of your professions of attachment, you shall hear again from me shortly; but, until you do, please make no reply to this, as further correspondence might compromise me in the estimation of my parents, without attaining the object you have in view.
I remain, dear sir, Yours, with respect,
From a Gentleman, Proposing Marriage.
Ever since I have had the happiness of becoming acquainted with you, the thought of your charms and accomplishments has been continually present in my mind, and though I dread the possibility of my suit being rejected, I can no longer conceal the passion which has preyed on my spirits these few months past.
My heart is wholly yours. With it I now frankly offer you my hand; and should you make me the happiest of mortals by a frank acceptance of it, my utmost endeavor will be to make your life agreeable and happy.
I believe you have some relatives who can give you all the necessary information concerning my character and circumstances, and the respectability of my family. It is now three years since I have been settled in business, my success being far beyond my own expectations; and, having a prospect of continued prosperity, I ardently long for a genial companion to share its fruits and impart to my home that unfading charm which your delightful presence would give.
Let me entreat for my proposal your kindest consideration.
Requesting the favor of an early reply, I remain, dear Miss Breen, Yours sincerely and devotedly,
The Lady’s Reply, Favorable.
Dear Mr. James: 
I have just read your kind and very flattering letter, and, believe me, it has so upset me that I scarcely know how or what to reply.
You cannot but have observed that the favorable impressions I received on the night of our first meeting have gradually deepened as our intimacy has matured, and it would be false modesty in me to disclaim a feeling of sincerest and most affectionate regard for you, after such undoubted proofs of your attachment.
I think I need say no more than that your proposals, if made in proper form to my parents, will find a warm and not uninterested advocate in one to whom the acceptance of them will be happiness, their rejection a misfortune.
Excuse the brevity of this letter, for I cannot trust myself to say more than that I am  Yours affectionately,
To the Young Lady’s Father.
Dear Sir,
I trust you will not consider my conduct rash or presumptuous, or wanting in respect to yourself and family, when I explain my object in addressing you at this time, and as the matter is one which very nearly concerns my happiness, let me request your kind attention and forbearance.
Having had the pleasure of meeting your daughter, Miss May, frequently at the house of Mrs. S———, I have been so impressed with her amiability of disposition, her lady-like manners and accomplishments, that my feelings of friendship have ripened into sincere and honorable attachment.
I presume that my character and position in society are so well known to Miss May that I may be spared the disagreeable egotism of referring to them more minutely.
As regards my worldly circumstances, my income from an established and prosperous business is, I believe, amply sufficient to meet the expenses of housekeeping and a family in a comfortable style.
In conclusion, I have the highest satisfaction in assuring you that my affection for your daughter is reciprocated; and, should yourself and Mrs. Breen sanction my proposals, I shall ever esteem it a privilege, as well as a duty, to promote your daughter’s happiness, thereby doubly securing my own.
An early reply will greatly oblige, Yours, very respectfully,
Father’s Reply, Favorable.
Dear Sir,
I am in receipt of your letter of April 8 and, in reply, I would say that although neither Mrs. Breen nor myself would offer opposition to our daughter’s choice in affairs of the heart, unless we apprehended ill consequences therefrom, a sense of parental duty requires prudent deliberation on our part before returning a decisive answer to your communication.
May’s acquaintance with you must be so slight that we should wish to make some necessary inquiries. There can be no doubt, from the candor and honor apparent in your letter, that the result will be satisfactory.
You may expect to hear from us again in the course of the week.
Meantime, on behalf of Mrs. Breen and myself, I remain, Yours faithfully,
From a Gentleman to a Lady with Whom He Is in Love.
I have three times attempted to give you a verbal relation of the contents of this letter; but my heart has as often failed.
I know not in what light it may be considered, only if I can form any notion of my own heart from the impression made on it by your many amiable accomplishments, my happiness in this world will, in a great measure, depend on your answer.
I am not precipitate, dear Miss —————, nor would I desire your hand if your heart did not accompany it.
My circumstances are independent, and my character is unblemished, of which you shall have the most undoubted proof.
You have already seen some of my relatives at your aunt’s in Richmond street, particularly my mother, with whom I now live.
Your aunt will inform you concerning our family, and if it is to your satisfaction, I shall not only consider myself extremely happy, but shall also make it the principal study of my future life to make happy one whom I do prefer to all others in the world.
I shall wait for your answer with the utmost impatience. Your true admirer,
From a Man Commencing Business, to a Wholesale House
Gentlemen:
I have established myself in business here with every prospect of success, and I desire to open an account with your house, hoping it will be to our mutual advantage.
With this in view I inclose an order, to be filled with the least possible delay and on your lowest terms, for which I will thank you.
As this is a first transaction, upon receipt of the invoice less the discount for cash, I shall remit a sight draft on a bank in your city for the amount.
Referring you to Messrs. E. & Co., of this place, I am, gentlemen,
Yours respectfully,
Letter from a Soldier.
Dear ...,
At length the dreaded time has arrived which is to separate us, perhaps forever.
God grant it may not be so, but a soldier’s life, my dear Mary, is very uncertain and precarious.
But believe me, amidst every danger and difficulty of my career, I shall ever think fondly of our acquaintance, and hope that a time may come when peace shall be restored, and when we shall be united as man and wife.
God bless you, my dear Mary.
Your devoted lover,
George Washington to Benjamin Franklin,
American Minister in France.
Philadelphia, 28 December, 1778.
Sir,
The Marquis de Lafayette, having served with distinction as major-general in the army of the United States for two campaigns, has been determined, by the prospects of a European war, to return to his native country.
It is with pleasure that I embrace the opportunity of introducing to your acquaintance a gentleman, whose merits cannot have left him unknown to you by reputation.
The generous motives which first induced him to cross the Atlantic; the tribute which he paid to gallantry at Brandywine; his success in Jersey before he had recovered from his wounds, in an affair where he commanded militia against British grenadiers; the brilliant retreat, by which he eluded a combined manoeuvre of the whole British force in the last campaign his services in the enterprise against Rhode Island; are such proofs of his zeal, military ardor, and talents, as have endeared him to America, and must greatly recommend him to his Prince.
Coming with so many titles to claim your esteem, it were needless for any other purpose, than to indulge my own feelings, to add, that I have a very particular friendship for him; and that whatever services you have it in your power to render him will confer an obligation on one who has the honor to be, with the greatest esteem, regard, and respect, sir, etc. 
Goods Lost by Express.
Gentlemen:
I beg to inform you of the non-arrival of the two packages ordered by me on August 10, and which by yours of August 15 I notice were forwarded by the American Express on that day.
I must ask your immediate attention to this matter, as the customers for whom they are required are anxiously awaiting their arrival.
It is indispensable that I should receive them in season for the purpose for which they are intended.
Otherwise my customers will not only be annoyingly disappointed, but the goods will be left on my hands.
Pray institute inquiries about them at once.
Yours truly,
Notifying an Express Company of Loss.
The American Express Co.:
Two packages of value, delivered to your company on August 15 for transmission to Mr. A. B. Messer, of Syracuse, have not arrived at their destination.
Should the packages not reach him by tomorrow night, we shall forward duplicate contents of each package, and hold your company responsible for the cost of the articles and all damage resulting from the delay.
It is proper that we also apprise you of the fact that it is necessary that the goods should be delivered before tomorrow night, for if they are not, their discovery will be of no use.
Hoping your inquiries may lead to a discovery of their whereabouts, we are, Yours respectfully,
An Announcement of Failure.
Gentlemen:
We are sorry at being obliged to inform you that, owing to unforeseen events, we shall be compelled to suspend payments.
Upon balancing our books to September 1, we discovered so considerable a deficiency, resulting from a combination of circumstances, that we concluded to submit our affairs to the inspection of our principal creditors, who have, after a full investigation, decided to appoint trustees, for the sale of our property and distribution of the proceeds, pro rata, among our creditors.
Hoping you will not object to this arrangement, we will ask you to send immediately to Messrs. S. W. Barrett and C. P. Oliver the account you hold against us, so that it may be compared with our books, for the purpose of ascertaining the correct balance.
Yours respectfully,
Requesting Extension of Time on a Note.
Dear Sir:
I fear I shall be unable to meet my note for $540.87, due July 10, and in consequence must ask you to grant me the favor of a renewal for thirty days, at the end of which time I shall be ready to cancel it.
Respectfully yours,
Dissolution of Partnership.
Gentlemen:
We beg to apprise you that the copartnership hitherto existing between Messrs. Read & Co., of San Francisco, and ourselves expired by limitation on March 1, and in accordance with the desire of all parties the same was not renewed.
We shall consequently have no interest in the new firm formed by our late partners in San Francisco.
At the same time we avail ourselves of this occasion to solicit a continuance of your usual patronage.
Yours truly,
Dear Little Marie:

Papa and Mama can read this letter to you, as you cannot read it yourself yet; but only wait till this time four years; ah, then you'll be able to read everything, I know.
I am in the country now, like you...
It is so nice, and I have had some strawberries — large, red strawberries, with cream.
Have you had any?
One can taste them right down in one’s stomach.
Yesterday I went down to the sea... and sat on a rock by the shore.
Presently a large white bird that they call a gull came flying along.
It flew right toward me, so that I fancied it would have slapped me with its wings; but, mercy on us, it said, “Mamaree!”
“Why, what’s the matter?” I asked.
“Mama-ree!” it said again, and then, of course, I understood that “Ma-ma-ree” meant Marie. ‘Oh,” said I, “then you bring me a greeting from Marie, that’s what it is, eh?”
“Ya-ya!Ma-ma-ree, Ma-ma-ree,” it said.
It couldn’t say it any better than that, for it only knew the gull language and that is not very much like ours.
“Thanks for the greeting,” said I, and off flew the gull.
After that, as I was walking in the garden, a little sparrow came flying up —“I suppose you now have flown a long way?” said I.
“Vit, vit” (far, far), it said.
“Did you see Marie?” I asked.
“Tit, tit, tit” (often, often, often), it said.
“Then give my greeting to Marie, for I suppose you are going back?” I said.
“Lit, lit” (a little, little), it replied.
If it has not come yet, it will come later on, but first I'll send you this letter.
You may feed the little bird if you like, but you must not squeeze it.
Now greet from me all good people, all sensible beasts and all the pretty flowers that wither before I see them. Isn’t it nice to be in the country, to paddle in the water, to eat lots of nice things, and to get a letter from your sweetheart?

Hawthorne to His Little Daughter, Rose.
My dear Little Rosebud,
I have put a kiss for you in this nice clean paper.
I shall fold it up carefully, and I hope it will not drop out before it gets to Lisbon.
If you cannot find it, you ask Mamma to look for it. Perhaps you will find it on her lips.
Give my best regards to your Uncle John and Aunt Sue and to all your kind friends, not forgetting your nurse.
Your affectionate father, N. H.
Henry Van Dyke to the Junior Class in the Shortridge High School at Indianapolis.
Avalon, Princeton, N. J.
Jan. 25, 1902.
My dear friends,
Your very kind letters have been forwarded to me by Miss ————, and have interested me greatly.
Your teacher evidently believes that English Literature is a living subject, and is not to be studied by “laboratory method,” but by vital methods.
This seems to me the right way.
Great authors are not algebraic symbols; they are real men.
Great books are not chemical products to be analyzed; they are messages from life to life; they are reflections of the human heart; they are works of art, to be valued for the joy they give and the meaning they impart.
I am glad that you think and speak of Tennyson’s characters as living persons, so that you have your favorites among them, and even have disputes and friendly quarrels about the comparative merits of your heroes and heroines.
I knew two schoolmates who had a regular fight about David Copperfield and Henry Esmond.
We did not “fight to a finish,” so it did us no harm; but I still think Esmond by far the finer character.
Tennyson is rightly considered the most perfect artist among Nineteenth Century English Poets.
But this is not merely because his verse is rich and musical; it is because his work is also true, even in the smallest details.
You remember that beautiful bit in “Maud”: “Her feet have touched the meadows And left the daisies rosy”?
If an American poet had written that about an American girl, it would have been sentimental nonsense.
Why?
Because the American daisy is all white and yellow. There is nothing rosy about it.
But the English daisy is really pink on the under side of its petals. So when Maud crossed the field she really left her footprints  marked in rose-color in the upturned flowers where she had trodden.
If you are going to write about anything, the first thing to do is to see it as it really is; then you may let your imagination illuminate it, and interpret the bare fact in “The light that never was on sea or land, The consecration and the poet’s dream.”
It will not be possible to answer each of your letters separately; and to pick out one for a response would hardly be fair to the other one hundred and twenty-four.
But I would like to tell you all a little story about Tennyson, and leave you to say whether you think it throws any light on his character.
When I was staying at his house in 1892 (a few weeks before the last illness), he promised to write an autograph for his portrait for me.
“What shall I write?” he asked.
Thinking of his good life and his great fame, I suggested a line from the Wellington Ode:
“The path of duty is the way to glory.”
He wrote it, and then turning over the sheet he said, “Now I will write what I prefer.”
This was his choice:
“Love took up the Harp of Life and smote on all the chords with might,
Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, past in music out of sight.”
Will you give my sincere regards to your teacher, and my thanks to her for the pleasure she has given me?
I think, if you are wise, you will give her also your own thanks for the work she has done to make your studies interesting and your interests studious.
I am glad if any of you like my books.
They are all about the same subject, the only one that seems to me worth writing about, Life.
And this is what I hope you all will have (in the real sense), and use it for the highest ends, and enjoy it forever.
Sincerely yours, Henry Van Dyke.
Impressions of a Newcomer.
Dear Samuel:
Here I have been in America for a whole month and living as roommate with my only friend and acquaintance, Krikor.
When I arrived here—after a hard journey and much fatigue—I had in my pocket only $3.50, a sum which is not sufficient for even a week’s board, without counting the rent of a room.
At present Krikor is paying both my room rent and my expenses at the restaurant.
But as I see his daily ten hours’ hard work and the meagerness of his savings I cannot help feeling badly.
He has his own dear ones dependent upon him, and now I have come to be a new burden to him.
He is very kind and always comforts me by expressing hope that I shall find work soon.
But I am in constant anxiety.
I would not care if he were rich, or a man obtaining high wages. So many men come to this country and find work in some way or other. I should not be an exception. But I am afraid that by the time I find work my debts will have increased so much that Krikor will be embarassed in not being able to help his parents.
They tell me that the work is very hard. I have no idea of it, because it is not allowed us, the idle, to go into the factory and see the work.
But I can get some idea of the hardness of the work by looking at the faces of my poor countrymen.
Almost all of them are pale and thin.
Perhaps you remember Hagop, the apprentice of a jeweler. I had no personal acquaintance with him, but his face was familiar to me. What a nice looking young fellow he was! He is entirely changed now.
Such faces make me sad and feel like crying.
When I was at home I wished so much to be in America. Even during the journey I longed for a quick arrival.
But this condition of lack of work is worse than seasickness and the fatigue of the journey.
I was eager for the land of liberty, and now I fail to see freedom. If you are without work, you may wander aimlessly in the streets. You will see hundreds of faces, stern or cheerful, but always indifferent toward you, and among the great multitude you will feel lonely and sad.
Some vague feeling of homesickness creeps into your heart, making you weary, and you walk like a somnambulist.
If you get work, the hours are so long that you must say good-bye to the daylight and sunny sky.
What pleasant walks we used to take out of town when the day’s work was done!
The only freedom for foreigners like ourselves is drudgery in a factory, and now I cannot get even that.
I am ready to swallow my pride and sweep the floor; but I am not allowed to enjoy that "privilege".
I do not know the language and cannot express myself.
Every morning with many others I loiter before the gates of the factory.
Sometimes we wait for hours and no one looks at us.
Sometimes the boss comes and picks out one or two men. What happiness for the chosen ones!
And the rest of us turn away disappointed.
I don’t know how long this state of affairs will last.
I feel very much discouraged as I think that I am a burden to someone else.
I am sorry for writing a letter that is so tiresome and so lacking in words of joy.
But let us hope for better days.
Yours truly,
Impressions of a Newcomer.
Dear ... ,
Of course you are expecting some information about America.
In my previous letter I promised to write, and now I will tell you what I have observed in these three months.
I am more fortunate than a great many others in having a brother here who has his own independent work, and therefore I did not have to face the hard problem of finding a job.
My brother did not want me to shut myself up in the store at once, and allowed me to look around and study my new surroundings. Consequently I spent my time in going to the library and to the theaters, in visiting museums, etc.
The people of New York are the most extraordinary mixture in the world. They are smart, lively, studious, strenuous, and hustling.
When I was at home we used to call America the antipode of Turkey from a geographical point of view; now, in the same sense, I must call Turkey the antipode.
But what a contrast between the two antipodes!
There everything goes slowly, in accordance with the Turkish motto of "Yavash yavash". But here everything goes very fast, in compliance with the American slogan of "Hurry up".
It is worth while seeing how people, men and women, old and young, hurry and even run.
The means of transportation are adjusted to the demand of haste: electric cars, trains, automobiles, etc., run full of people.
The elevated trains run constantly, with awful noise, above the streets, in subways, in the tunnel under the Hudson River, and yet people always run to catch the first car or the first train.
But what wonderful order in this hurly-burly! It is surprising that hundreds of people are not trampled every day under the feet of the travelling crowd or smashed under the wheels of the cars.
Beside the trains in the tunnel under the Hudson—which, being so near the ocean, is very wide—steamships or ferryboats cross the water all the time.
Everywhere both in the tunnel and above the water passengers are crowded. On the other side, over the East River, four huge suspension bridges join Brooklyn with New York. Electric trains, cars, automobiles, etc., always full of people, cross these bridges in both directions, and ferryboats are likewise in activity.
Where do these people come from and where do they go?
Especially in the morning and in the evening, when people go to or come from work, the rush is indescribable.
We are taught that those who hurry do not arrive quickly, but we never arrive by our slowness, while the American is taught to hurry, and he arrives quickly.
The American has not been satisfied by saying, “Hurry up;” he has found the secrets of quick arriving, and he uses them safely.
Now, you will ask me, Who is the American? Is he the Yankee? The Englishman? The Jew? The German? The Irishman? Or the Italian?
The question is not so simple.
If we examine the respective numbers of the different elements composing the population of the city of New York we shall find interesting figures.
It is not possible to ascertain what proportion of nearly five million inhabitants of New York are descendants of the Revolutionary generation, which proportion should be considered the real Americans.
There are about one million Jews, two hundred thousand Spaniards, and perhaps as many Italian and French people, the rest are Irish, English, Germans, Scandinavians, Russians, Poles, Syrians, and even several thousand Chinese (who cannot be Americans), a considerable number of negroes, etc.
The number of Armenians is very small compared with other elements and yet there are at least five thousand of them.
Of all these elements Americans are those who are citizens; especially those citizens who were born in this country.
In theory, at least, the Jew, Italian, German, Armenian, etc., who is born on the soil of the United States is equally an American with the descendants of the Revolutionary generation: but the latter preserve for themselves a just pride and represent, if not the ruling, at least the leading element.
At any rate, the Puritans who resisted English rule and the Dutch who first inhabited New York were assimilated into Americanism. These started a new life in this new world to which all newcomers have adapted themselves.
Therefore, Americanism is a matter of adaptation, rather than a question of blood.
By the word Americans we cannot conceive of a nation of a single race or tribe, as we do by the words Greek, Bulgarian, Armenian, etc.
The stream of emigrants that pours into the new world harmonizes itself wonderfully with prevailing conditions; and the political principles of the country and its power of civilization adopt them into Americanism.
Naturally the newcomers are in unfavorable conditions, but their children enjoy the advantages of the native.
I do not want to stop here to analyze the class struggle, which is the same in its essence as in other countries; but I want to point out that a people, employers and employees, in spite of the extraordinary mixture, have adopted the language of the first emigrants and have produced wonders which hardly can be seen in other countries.
Great wonderworks are accomplished by the administrative power and tact of the employers, and by the skill and quick-working hands of the laborers.
The employers have put to work the brains and the hands of different classes of working people and one cannot help admiring the result.
The City of New York, being situated between two rivers, the East and the Hudson Rivers, and being bounded on another side by the Atlantic Ocean, has only one direction in which to grow, and it extends for miles in that one direction: and yet its area is too small for its greatness.
And because there is no room on the ground men have decided to conquer the heavens. The buildings, especially commercial buildings and hotels, rise into the firmament fifteen, twenty, thirty stories.
One can hardly count them.
Most of the high buildings have giganitc greatness but not art.
Everywhere you see huge walls covered with windows, and if you look down from the top windows the human multitude below will give the impression of swarming ants.
A ten story building appears a dwarf in the presence of twenty or more story buildings, and for this very reason the general panorama of New York looks very confused and unharmonious.
A thorough cleanliness prevails in those big buildings.
The basements, floors, staircases, and walls are either of marble or of tile.
To climb up the flights for business would be very tiresome and a waste of time.
The staircases are made for decoration rather than for use.
The elevators run day and night and, in a minute, they can take you to the top.
Masterpieces of art are not wanting.
The Public Library, the theaters, railroad stations, and museums are splendid specimens of architecture.
It is in such a world that I begin a new life.
Shall I be able to secure ground in this orderly Babylon?
I don’t know. But I will try.
Here is a long letter for you.
It is not possible to describe everything. I may write in the future some new details and give further information.
Write oftener and long letters to Your friend as ever,
The Answer.
Showing a Desire to Come to America.
Dear ... ,
I was looking impatiently for a letter from you. But it came at last and gave me great pleasure.
I read it almost in a breath, and reread it several times.
It stimulated me greatly, and filled my mind with many thoughts.
I can no longer restrain myself. I must tell you what I think and feel.
Is it worth while to stay in this dreary country where there is no liberty, no peace, no security and no prospect?
Moreover, the financial situation is growing worse.
What can a fellow do with a salary of two pounds a month?
I myself desire to breathe the air of that land of liberty and progress. I want to see all its wonderworks, and in that way improve the poor education that our school gave me.
Of course, it is also a pleasant dream to think of obtaining a college education. If I were there and unable to enjoy the privileges of college life I should think the environment and the very atmosphere of the country would be enough to supply considerable knowledge to those who have an earnest desire to learn.
My desire to leave the country is not due to lack of patriotism.
I have no intention to leave our land for ever.
I want to be absent for some time in order to grow in love of the fatherland.
Because what service can our country expect from me when I am nothing but a bookkeeper of a small dealer?
But what to do and how to go I do not know.
Even if I work ten years, with my present earnings I cannot save enough for the expenses of the journey.
I am tempted to ask you to give me the necessary sum as a loan; but I know that you are new there and not in condition to comply with my request.
What do you say? What is your advice?
Is there any possibility of my coming to America?
I am afraid my letter will give you worry. At present I want your opinion and nothing else.
Write me soon and long!
I have no news, nothing of interest to give you. Life moves along with its usual uneventfulness.
Yours truly,
An Encouraging Reply.
Dear ... ,
I was glad to receive your letter but I felt rather sorry when I read it.
I expected you would write cheerful lines and communicate to me that jolly disposition which is yours.
I wonder if my letter contained such sentiments as to indicate the pride of a man enjoying unusual advantages.
Did my letter arouse in you that dissatisfaction with your condition?
I don’t blame you for your desire to come here.
As long as I am here I have no right to exhort you to stay at home in order not to vacate our country by emigration.
When I return home myself, then I shall be justified in speaking against emigration.
In fact, I am against emigration, especially after seeing the life of poor Armenian working men.
As I wrote you in my previous letter, I am very lucky in being exempt from such a life, thanks to my brother.
Although I think it is useless for many Armenians to come to this country, I would not hinder a man who has some ideals to pursue.
Some day our country may gain a great deal by the return of such young men.
Since you are so much dissatisfied with the conditions at home and have cherished ideals, which you hope to pursue freely if you come to this country, I agree that you should come and try. But just now I am not in a position to help you.
My brother has begun to pay me twelve dollars a week for my services.
Living with him, my expenses are little, and as I do not help the folks at home, I can save at least six dollars a week.
You will need about $150. I can make that sum ready in six months. I may soon have other chances to earn or I may borrow a little to help you.
Now it is winter. By the time I am able to help you it will be summer, which is the most pleasant season for travel.
Now, dear fellow, don’t lose your courage.
You shall have your share of this life, and we may do something by working together.
Begin your preparations now, and don’t forget to write me cheerful letters.
At present I cannot give you any new information, but I promise to do so within a couple of weeks.
Now I close, saying goodbye.
Yours very truly,
The Answer
Dear ...,
I can’t describe what happiness your letter brought me.
I am sorry that I wrote my previous letter under the influence of troubled thoughts, which I never meant to do.
Your promise dispels the gloomy clouds of an uncertain life and opens a new horizon before me.
I shall come to America! It seems to me a dream, and I can hardly believe myself.
But here is your letter, your own autograph letter; I read it again and again.
Then, by and by, I shall cross the waves of the Atlantic, and I shall see the new world with you.
I can find no words to thank you for your kindness. I'll tell you this, that if I come and succeed I shall owe it to you. If I don’t succeed, I shall have lost nothing, and shall have the satisfaction of living in a highly civilized country.
I read your letter to my father and mother.
My father, after a thoughtful silence, consented, while mother’s eyes filled with tears. But when father assented she said that she would not be an obstacle in my way.
I am so happy that I cannot write any longer. I shall be waiting impatiently for your promised letter.
Before ending my letter I dance, I jump with joy, and, as an assurance of my happiness, I write to you of these acrobatic performances.
Yours very truly,
Information About Moving Picture Shows.
Dear ..., 
Moving picture theaters have become important resorts for amusement.
Providing an inexpensive pastime — inexpensive in point of view both of time and money — they have found great popularity.
Often what a theater of high standing gives at the cost of a dollar or more and two or three hours of time, a moving picture theater gives for ten cents and in half an hour.
Cheapness usually brings unpleasant consequences.
Most of such theaters amuse their patrons by nonsensical shows and destroy among them good taste and higher tendencies; but there are those which provide really edifying pictures.
For example, let me mention the story of Damon and Pythias, the representation of which I saw the other day in one of the moving picture theaters.
Dionysius was the despotic king of Syracuse.
Having gained the sympathy of a corrupt senate, he was ruling over the country with no feeling of responsibility whatever.
Pythias was the only honest man in the senate who opposed the tyrant.
The latter arrested him and condemned him to death.
Pythias wished to see his little child and pretty wife and arrange his affairs before his death.
His friend Damon consented to go to prison in his place until a specified day, when Pythias should return to bear his punishment by execution. Otherwise his friend would lose his head.
Pythias went home and took leave of his family; but when he was ready to return he found that his servant had, out of simple-minded kindness, slain his horse to prevent his going back.
Pythias was shocked at the sight of this misfortune, because his friend would be beheaded in his place; and, in a fury, seizing the servant, he threw him down a precipice.
After that he began to run madly through the forest and came across a horseman armed with sword and spear.
Before the latter could resort to self-defense Pythias knocked him down, jumped on the horse’s back, and galloped forward.
In the meantime, on the appointed day Damon was brought before the public to the place of execution. He had put his head in solemn submission on the block.
Just as the executioner raised his knife to give the terrible blow the steps of a galloping horse were heard, and suddenly the people, with an awful rush, stopped the hand of the executioner.
It was Pythias who was hastening forward to save his friend and honorably fulfill his promise.
Instantly he jumped down and threw himself before the executioner.
Dionysius was present disguised. Witnessing the wonderful example of devoted friendship, he threw aside his disguise and, coming forward as the king, he shook hands with the two friends and pardoned Pythias in token of his admiration.
It is said that moving pictures will be introduced for educational purposes.
Yours truly,
Dear ...,
I wrote you that America is an intensely materialistic country, where all the activities, rush, etc., have only one purpose, to increase the number of “almighty” dollars.
This is true to a great extent.
The American people pursue moneymaking with great zeal; but the same people also know how to enjoy life and show similar, even more animation in other directions than in hurrying to and from work.
It is worth while seeing how prettily dressed misses and mistresses, and young men in their best attire fill the theaters of a city, theaters which are fairylands in splendor.
It is an everyday affair.
Americans adore physical perfection in human beings more than wealth; they are very fond of Olympic, baseball and other games.
The daily papers devote several pages to the description and account of games in various parts of the country.
When the intercollegiate baseball season opens the popular enthusiasm and ardor pass all bounds.
The newsboys always shout the results of the games to sell their papers, which are full of descriptions.
Harvard University has a large field dedicated to such games; and in the spring and fall the students play every Saturday afternoon with athletes from other colleges.
There is an amphitheater in the field which provides about 40.000 seats: sometimes it is full to its utmost capacity.
One day in a year is reserved for a baseball game between Harvard and Yale.
That day seems like a holiday for the whole country.
Express and extra trains pour people — anxious to see the game — into Boston from New York and many other cities.
Each ticket is two dollars. But mortals like ourselves cannot buy them, because if they sold to everyone wishing to buy there would be no room in the field to stand.
Students can buy only a limited number of tickets for their relatives and friends.
In spite of the difficulty of getting tickets an unusual multitude of happy ticket-holders go to the stadium in long rows of packed electric cars, automobiles, bicycles, etc.
It is very interesting to see such a crowd of people in their best attire.
Students march in parade, headed by a band of music.
The excitement among the students begins weeks before, and as the day of the great game approaches they have parades in the evening with songs and cheers and a beautiful display of torches and colors.
Do not a people that pay so much attention to physical as well as moral education deserve admiration?
How monotonous and unattractive our school life is and how lively and happy that of Americans!
Yours sincerely,
My dear Hawthorne:
I have no masonic claim upon you except community of tobacco, and the young man who brings this does not smoke.
But he wants to look at you, which will do you no harm and him a great deal of good.
His name is Howells, and he is a fine young fellow, and has written several poems in the “Atlantic,” which of course you never read, because you don’t do such things yourself, and are old enough to know better...
If my judgment is good for anything, this youth has more in him than any of our younger fellows in the way of rhyme.
Of course he can’t hope to rival the “Consule Planco” men.
Therefore let him look at you and charge it 
To yours always, J. R. Lowell.
Letter of Condolence.
I learned with great sorrow of the death of your dear brother in his very youth.
Perhaps I should not be able to understand the greatness of your loss if I had not known your brother and his promising personality.
As I understand your grief I shall not attempt to console you by words, the most eloquent of which would be powerless in this sad case.
Permit me only to share your sorrow with you and to keep in my heart his dear memory.
To a Father upon the Death of His Son.
Dear Sir,
I was shocked by the sad news of the death of your beloved son.
It is hard to believe that such a lovable, intellectual, and energetic youth could fall a prey to death.
If it gives me such sorrow, what must be your affliction, which is that of a father!
I cannot be near you in body, but you may be assured that I am with you in heart and spirit.
I have no words to comfort you, and, although I share your sorrow, I cannot mitigate your grief.
But, dear friend, allow me to remind you that you made every sacrifice and did everything possible to save your dear child, and since all efforts proved unavailing we must comply with the inevitable.
Yours very truly,
Charles Dickens to Mark Lemon, on the Death of a Child, in 1835.
My dear Mark,
We are indeed greatly grieved at your calamity.
I have no need to tell you, dear fellow, how constantly you are in our thoughts, and that I have not forgotten, and never can forget, who it was that watched with me and comforted me the night a little place in my house was left empty.
We know you will both have found comfort in the blessed relief from which the sacred figure with the child on His knee is in all the stages of our lives inseparable. “For of such is the kingdom of Heaven.”
It is hard, God knows, to lose a child of any age, but there are many sources of comfort in losing one so young as yours.
There is a beautiful thought in “Fielding’s Journal from This World to the Next,” where the little one he had lost was found by him radiant and smiling, building him a bower in the Elysian Fields, where they were to live together when he came.
Ever, old friend, yours ever, Charles Dickens.
Lincoln’s Letter to a Mother Who Had Lost All Her Children in the Civil War.
November 21, 1864.
Dear Madam,
I have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement of the Adjutant-General of Massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle.
I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming.
But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save.
I pray that our heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.
Yours very sincerely and respectfully, Abraham Lincoln.
LETTERS OF CONGRATULATION.
To a Friend Graduating from a College.
Dear ...,
I received the news of your graduation with a great deal of pleasure. Let me in my weak words try to express my joy and congratulations.
This success of yours is not that of an ordinary student, it is the crowning result of your strenuous efforts, mental and bodily endurance, and resolute perseverance.
Trusting that your graduation is a sure step toward your cherished ideals, I pray that the future may have higher successes in store for you both for the happiness of your family and for the good of our nation.
Yours very truly,
The degree of S. B. which has been solemnly bestowed upon you by the University of Yale, as a result of your studious labors of years, gives me great pleasure. Heartily sharing your happiness with you, I now wish for you that the coming years may crown your efforts with new successes, Congratulating you with all my heart, I remain, Your admirer,
Birthdays may be called the milestones in life’s journey. As you reach another of those anniversary landmarks today, permit me to congratulate you on having traveled thus far in safety, and to wish you, with all my heart, many similar opportunities of receiving the good wishes of your friends.
That your future years may glide happily by, without care or sorrow, is the heartfelt prayer of Yours most sincerely,
On the Marriage of a Friend. 
The tidings of your happy marriage has just reached me, and I sincerely wish you joy and prosperity in this new life of yours.
I have long known the constant attachment and devotion which you have for the one so completely entrusted to your keeping, and I am confident in the belief that you will spare no effort to ensure every advancement of the material comforts this union may bring upon you.
That your enjoyment of these earthly felicities may be combined with Heaven’s choicest blessings is the prayer of Your true friend,
Marriage of a Friend.
The invitation to your wedding on the 20th has just reached me, and as I shall be unavoidably absent from the city on that day, and therefore, to my great regret, unable to witness the ceremony, I send you my congratulations by letter.
You are surely to be envied!
Fortune has had sweet smiles for you.
Successful in business, respected and very much liked in social circles, you now crown your happiness by taking, as a life-mate, one of the loveliest, brightest, and most intellectual of women!
That you have a brilliant future and a delightful home life before you seems beyond doubt. Such, at all events, is my ardent wish.
Yours very truly,
Letter from an Elder Brother.
Dear Brother Aram,
I was glad to receive your letter and learn all about your successes in school.
I want to express my deep satisfaction and to send you kisses with heartfelt joy.
Keep on sending me such news in regard to your school work.
You mentioned in your letter that you did not like certain subjects, but that you learned your lessons in them merely to keep pace with your classmates.
In your opinion it is not essential that a scholar should learn every subject taught in a school.
I am not of the same opinion.
Subjects given in an elementary school can hardly be unessential.
Each subject brings some definite aptitude to youngsters and develops it in them.
Those who intend to live a scholar’s life cannot afford to neglect any of their subjects of study, because every one of them has its place.
According to the information that I have derived from authoritative sources, success in the school life means success in the practical life of the world.
Leaders in political or other careers have been, with few exceptions, leaders in the life of the school period.
I have no doubt that in the biographies of great men you have come across persons whose conduct in school could not be recommended or whose success in scholarship was not enviable.
Such cases have their special reason, which I cannot take time to analyze.
If we should turn our attention to legions of those unsuccessful ones, who fill the world, we would find that the great majority of them did not have a good record in their school work.
Of course, I do not mean that a diligent schoolboy will necessarily occupy a distinguished position in future life. What I mean to say is this, that early success in school not only endows men with the power of thinking and observing, but also with the great gift of self-confidence.
Only a few men of genius have ascended to their high positions through their innate endowment; a great genius is a phenomenon in life.
Our present civilization is not necessarily created and developed by a few talented men, but by millions of hard-working, perseverent men who have earnestly tried to do their best.
If a person begins in school to do his best, he will store a big supply of physical and moral strength. It is this supply that secures places in art and literature for men who have not exceptional talents.
Our purpose is not to be exceptional men in the world, but to be worthy of the elevation of men.
Now, this brilliant school period must not spoil you, and you must not think of yourself as an exceptional genius.
Such thoughts lead to arrogance.
True and the most beautiful greatness is not subjected to self-consciousness.
It is not a good principle to learn something merely not to be left behind others.
As long as you are going to learn it, try first to love it, try to see the worth of the subject and study it for its own sake.
I am confident that these few remarks will stimulate new zeal in you to love all your studies.
Make it your chief aim, not to surpass others, but to reach perfection.
Your loving brother,
It is now nearly a year since I first had the great and highly appreciated pleasure of being received at your house on the footing of a friend.
During all that time, I will frankly confess that one attraction, and later one strong hope has been drawing me ever to your residence, and I need scarcely add that your own dear self was the attraction, the desire of winning your favorable regard, my hope.
Have I been successful?
Has the deep, faithful love that I feel for you any response in your heart?
All my hope of happiness in the future hangs upon, your answer, for mine is not the fleeting fancy of an hour, but the true, abiding love that is founded upon respect and esteem, and has been for months my life dream.
Your own maidenly dignity has kept your heart so securely hidden from me that I scarcely venture to hope I have a place there, but I feel that I cannot endure suspense any longer, and so write to win or lose all.
If you will be my wife, it will be the pride of my life to try to shield you from all sorrow, and to give you all the happiness that a tender, loving husband can bestow upon his first and only love.
Hoping to hear from you soon, I am, with respect and devotion, Yours faithfully,
Favorable Reply
My dear Mr. ...,
Your kind and manly letter opens my eyes to the fact that what I believed to be only a warm friendship is a stronger feeling.
I see that it would be a pain to me to lose your visits and presence, and that such love as you promise your wife would make me very happy.
You see that I answer you frankly, deeming it wrong to trifle with such affection as you offer to me.
I have shown your letter to my parents, and they desire me to say that they will be pleased to have you call this evening to see them.
With kindest regards, I am, Yours truly,
FAMILY LETTERS.
Dear Father,
After a long and tiresome journey I arrived here safely yesterday, and now, at my first opportunity, I am writing to you.
Uncle came to meet me and helped me out without any difficulty.
Thanks to him I am free from the hardships of a strange country. I only miss you.
Today this new house seems strange to me without Father and Mother. I have no doubt that I could not stand it without my uncle.
Dear Father, although I am so far from you now, the love for you that I have in my heart will always lead me aright to be a son worthy of you and to work for your happiness.
After the rest of last night I feel that I have recovered my strength and am ready to work.
Uncle assures me that the work is not as hard as is thought, and that if a man takes good care of his health it does not do any harm.
Uncle advises me to rest at least a couple of weeks and then go to work.
He thinks it is not hard to get work.
Although I am impatient to go to work, I shall wait in accordance with Uncle’s advice.
After this I will try to write you at least once every other week.
Your grateful son,
Dear Mother,
Having just arrived, I am in the grip of homesickness and cannot write very long.
I only want to notify you by this brief letter of my safe arrival and good health.
I shall not forget your advice and shall always try to be a good boy.
Although I am now deprived of your caresses, I know that you love me and that knowledge will be my comfort.
Upon my arrival here I found Uncle in good health.
He says that my being with him makes him feel at home.
I shall always keep you informed about my life in America, writing you regularly once in two weeks; one week to you, and the next week to Father, so that you will get a letter from me every week.
Remember me to all our relatives.
I cannot write to them all individually, but they may be sure that I shall always remember them with pleasure.
You will find a letter from Uncle enclosed.
Your obedient son, Melkon.
To His Sister.
Dear Sister Vartouhi,
This is my first letter to you from a faraway land.
It seems strange to me to be without Mother, Father and Sister.
When I was with you we wished so much to see Uncle; now I am happy in that respect, but I would be much happier if we were all together and could spend our evenings in our family games and recreations.
While at home I could not imagine how hard it would be to be deprived of my sister.
I have many things to tell you, many things that I have seen to describe to you, but you are not with me and I cannot write all of them.
As soon as I get used to this new life I will write you long letters.
As I write this letter I am all alone in the room, Uncle being at his work.
I walk a little in the room; I go out from the house, but not daring to go far, I come back to the room.
If I could be with Uncle all the time I would not feel so lonely.
When I begin to work I shall be free from: this restlessness, and this melancholy caused by loneliness.
It will be my happiness to think of you and of all.
Write me soon.
I am looking for long letters from you.
I myself promise to write longer.
Your affectionate brother,
Dear Uncle:
I have been in America now for several days and am trying to adapt myself to the conditions of the country.
At present I am resting at my uncle’s.
I can never lose the memory of home.
When I was there I could not realize the happiness that one enjoys with parents and among relatives.
I remember how happy I was whenever you came home to see us and to converse with Father.
I remember all the caresses you gave me, and I keep with tenderness your gifts, which are precious to me.
I miss you so much that I cannot resist a homesick feeling.
I find some comfort now in writing.
I could not endure this life if I were not with my uncle.
In the evenings we talk about you all and thus we make our leisure hours a thorough resting time.
Dear Uncle, I assure you I shall never have peace of mind without writing you once in a while.
And if I receive letters from you I shall be very happy.
With love, Your nephew,
Uncle’s Letter to His Sister.
Dear Sister:
Melkon is already writing you in regard to his arrival. I only want to assure you by this note that I shall give him all the assistance in my power and try to make his life as comfortable as possible.
Unfortunately I am not a successful man to secure for him a good position; but I shall try anyhow to help him learn some useful art so that in a few years he may return to you with skill and with a little capital.
If my plans work well I myself may leave my work and return to spend the rest of my life among my relatives and friends.
I have no doubt that you find it very hard to have Melkon away from home.
His presence here gives me some feeling of home. Now, while working in the daytime, I know that upon my return to my room I shall not find the walls only, but also my dear nephew.
I do hope that his coming may prove beneficial both to you and to himself.
He is a lively and bright fellow and I am sure he will soon find his way to success.
Give my love to my brother, to my dear niece Vartuhi, and all relatives.
Your brother,
Dear Brother:
I was glad to receive your letter, which gave all of us comfort.
We sent Melkon to America in order to satisfy his desire and not to sacrifice his future to our love.
But we could never have consented to it if your protection and care for him were not secure.
Dear Brother, you say that Melkon’s presence gives some feeling of home.
Those lines filled my eyes with tears.
You have been away from home for ten years, and this is the first time that you have spoken of returning, and that after waiting until Melkon is ready to come back to his parents.
My dear brother, you have not yet lost your youth; you are still a strong young man, for you are hardly thirty-five years old.
Why don’t you think of marrying and settling down?
If you marry and desire, after a few years, to return with Melkon—which is our heartfelt wish —you will bring your wife with you and we shall all be happy here.
If you once begin to think of this you will be able to find a companion either there or here.
There are many suitable girls in our town, most of whom you know; if your heart makes a choice, I am sure you will not be disappointed.
Then take this seriously and rejoice your sister by writing a good approving letter.
With love from us all, Your affectionate sister, Makrouhi Arsenian.
Father’s Answer.
My dear son:
We were waiting impatiently for the news of your safe arrival, and at last your letters to me, to your mother and sister came to dispel all anxiety.
I am glad that you are with your uncle and enjoy his kind protection.
Of course it is very hard for us to be deprived of you. In your absence the house seems empty, but as I have not been fortunate enough to secure the future happiness of my children I could not insist upon your staying here and thus deprive you of your pursuits.
You wished to go to America, and your mother and I decided not to oppose you.
Now, as you are in America, all that is left for us is to pray that you may realize your cherished ideals.
Dear son, if your father were not so poor he would have sent you to America for study and not for work.
What your parents could not do I hope you may be able to do for yourself.
Take good care of yourself. Remember that you are our only wealth and comfort.
You are a young fellow and have a whole life before you. Carry on your work with courage.
May Heaven permit us to see you again before death as a strong and successful man!
With love from us all to you and your uncle,
Your father
Mother’s Answer.
My dear boy,
After you left for America our home was almost a mournful one. Your letter brought us cheering sunshine for the first time.
As a mother I could not restrain my tears, but they were refreshing rather than burning tears.
I poured off my sorrow with them.
I am keeping your letter as a precious object and reading it every little while.
I am confident that your dear uncle takes good care of you and that you live strong in body and mind.
Dear boy, do not work very hard. Take care of your health for your sake and for our sakes.
The only happiness for all of us will be to hear from you constantly and to be informed about your health.
I would like, if it were possible, to hear from you every day, but I do not want you to tire yourself in that way or to worry about it.
If one of us, your father, sister and myself, get a letter from you alternately every week, we shall be satisfied and comforted.
My dear, I wish with all my heart that America may become a source of prosperity and happiness to you, and that some day you may return to your loving parents with all the successes for which you long.
Your mother, Makrouhi Arsenian.
Sister’s Answer.
Dear Brother,
I am very happy, because you remembered me in the midst of your worries in a faraway land.
You cannot imagine what sorrow filled our house after you left.
Father always talked about you in the evenings and often said with a sigh: “I wonder where my boy is now, if the sea affects him,” etc.
Mother frequently went to your picture and cried, looking at it, and my own heart was filled with sadness at being deprived of my only brother and thinking of the hardships which you might have to bear far away from us all. We are all glad that you are now with Uncle Vartan. How I wish that I could see him myself! Although I was little when he left us, I always remember him and love him.
Dear Brother, you can’t realize how glad I was for those lines in which you promised to write me a long letter.
You may be sure that such letters will make me the happiest and proudest among sisters.
I will try in my turn to write long letters and give you home news.
Uncle and his bride come oftener in order not to leave us alone.
The night before last Aunt E. and Koharig came. Both send you love.
At present I have no other news.
Your loving sister, Vartouhi.
Letter of a Man Who Is Satisfied With His Work.
Dear ...,
Since you went to San Francisco I have had only one letter from you, nothing more.
Where are you? And what are you doing?
Why don’t you send a word?
You know how much I always liked mechanics.
I could not go to a regular school to specialize in the subject, because I was not in a condition either to pass the admission examinations or to pay the expenses.
There are special shops where the practical manipulation of machines is taught for a hundred dollars.
I worked hard to save that sum and borrowed money to live for a few weeks while I went to learn the business.
I took up repairing and driving automobiles.
In less than two months I gained enough skill to obtain a certificate and pass the state examination, and now for the last three weeks I have been working in a machine shop.
I began with fifteen dollars a week. Next week they will raise it to eighteen, and at the end of the year to twenty-five dollars.
I am satisfied with my work.
When we Armenians come to America we don’t open our eyes. We see one of our acquaintances or a relative working in a factory, and we make it our ambition to get some job in the same factory for seven or eight dollars’ pay, and sometimes less than that.
We act as if the whole of America was in that factory.
We work for years and gain nothing, always insecure and unhappy in the work.
Gradually bitter feelings get hold of us, we begin to hate everything, curse the “bad luck,” hate the bosses, employers, etc.
The more our hatred and bitterness grow the more we retrogate and become unfitted for progress. Not only Americans dislike to see our cross expression, even our friends show coldness in their relations with us.
We turn against the whole world and naturally, with such a disposition, we limit ourselves to a corner of a factory and to our room.
In that way we become more and more dependent upon the bosses and work which we hate with all our might.
Some people confuse this kind of dissatisfaction with class consciousness; in fact, it is not even self-consciousness.
A man who becomes so blind on account of his bitter feelings that he cannot measure his own power and aptitude naturally cannot succeed.
The secret of success, in my opinion, is to be found in a cheerful indifference toward hardships.
I am afraid I have given you an unnecessary sermon.
Write me soon and inform me about yourself. Do you hear from home?
I am now in a position to teach my work to some friend.
I wish you were here. If you do not have satisfactory work come at once. I can get a job for you within the next few days. If you have good work let me know immediately so that I may be able to give the chance to another fellow Armenian.
Your friend,
Letter to an American Consul in Smyrna Asking Assistance at the Port.
Alexandria, Egypt,
May 1, 1914.
Hon. ------,
American Consul,
Smyrna, Turkey.
Dear Sir:
As a citizen of the United States I respectfully request your assistance at the port of Smyrna in case Turkish officials offer difficulties to my landing.
I have in my possession the regular passport from the Government at Washington, and I am coming for a short visit to my parents and other relatives.
I shall sail from Alexandria, Egypt, on the steamer Posidon of the Lloyd Steamship Company, on August 15, and expect to arrive at Smyrna on the first day of September.
Trusting I may have your help in case of need, I am Respectfully yours, A. M. Sanikian.
Letter to an Early Playmate.
Dear Miss ——,
This letter may seem to you strange and uncalled for. But I feel confident that I shall obtain indulgence in expressing freely the sacred feelings which I have always cherished for you, the playmate of my happy childhood.
In spite of so many years’ separation, I have not forgotten the play or conversations which took place in those days.
During my hard struggles your memory has been the sweetness of my life; when doing heavy labor, the remembrance of your innocent smile has brought me relief; and during my success I have suffered with longing to see you.
After much hardship I have succeeded in establishing an independent business for myself, with sufficient capital. It has already begun to give signs of success.
But my happiness will be very far from complete if your presence does not bring to me the one whom I adored even in my childhood.
Dear Miss —————, in spite of my trust in your indulgence, I cannot express myself as freely as I wish.
You have always been my ideal of a companion, and now if you decide to join your destiny with mine it will be my ambition to secure your happiness.
Your companionship will bring back to me the sunny days of my childhood.
I flatter myself with the belief that the charm of the old days has not vanished from your memory and that you will honor me with a reply.
With best regards,
Letter to Editors of a Publication Inquiring about Delayed Manuscript.
To the Editors of The Asbarez Publishing Company,
Gentlemen:
On April 10 I mailed you the manuscript of a story entitled, “Hard Lines,” with postage for its return in case it should not prove acceptable.
Will you kindly look the manuscript up, and if not available for your publication, return it to me at your earliest convenience?
Very truly yours,
Requesting the Renewal of a Note.
Gentlemen:
I regret to say that I will not be able to meet at maturity my note which you hold for $2,000, payable May 10.
Adverse circumstances, unforeseen and entirely beyond my control, have combined to embarrass me temporarily, but by no means seriously.
I would, therefore, ask at your hands the favor of a renewal for ninety days with interest added, assuring you that upon maturing the note will be redeemed.
Your compliance with this request will very materially relieve me in my present difficulties and place me under great obligations.
Very truly yours,
Requesting an Extension of Time.
Gentlemen:
I regret my delay in the settlement of your account and would ask your continued leniency, my affairs being in such shape at present as to preclude any possibility of complying with your demand.
If you can consistently grant me further indulgence, I would be pleased to relieve your embarrassment by sending you my note for sixty days, which is negotiable and will be promptly honored upon presentation at maturity.
Hoping for a favorable reply and thanking you for your courteous consideration heretofore in the matter, I am Very truly yours,
Requesting Clemency Concerning a Mortgage.
Dear Sir:
The mortgage deed on my farm which you hold as security for my note of $3,800, I understand can be foreclosed by suit if the note, which matures on June 10, is not paid.
I regret to inform you that it will be impossible for me to meet payment of the note when due; but I have every reason to believe that I will be in a position to do so a little later on.
The loss of this property would damage me very seriously just at this time, and if you can consistently extend to me a little indulgence in the matter, you will place me under great obligations.
I have always paid the interest with regularity, and I herewith inclose a check for $57, the interest due for the last quarter.
My income is sufficient to insure continued prompt payment of interest; a consideration which I trust may weigh in my favor.
Awaiting a reply at your earliest convenience, informing me as to your intentions in the matter, I am Yours truly,
Reply.
Dear Madam:
Your letter of April 3, inclosing a check for $57, is received.
You may rest assured that, in consideration of your past promptness in the payment of interest and my confidence in your intention and ability to take up the note within a reasonable time, I shall take no step which will in any way tend to cause you embarrassment.
In fact, the mortgage is a good investment for any one whose capital is not actively employed, and should I at any time require the money for other purposes, I will see that you have ample time to effect a transfer of the mortgage.
I am, Madam, Yours truly,
January 2, 1851.
Dear Johnston,
Your request for eighty dollars I do not think it best to comply with now.
At the various times when I have helped you a little you have said to me, “We can get along very well now”; but in a very short time I find you in the same difficulty again.
Now, this can only happen by some defect in your conduct.
What that defect is, I think I know.
You are not lazy, and still you are an idler.
I doubt whether, since I saw you, you have done a good whole day’s work in any one day.
You do not very much dislike to work, and still you do not work much, merely because it does not seem to you that you could get much for it.
This habit of uselessly wasting time is the whole difficulty; it is vastly important to you, and still more so to your children, that you should break the habit.
It is more important to them, because they have longer to live, and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it, easier than they can get out after they are in.
You are now in need of some money; and what I propose is, that you shall go to work, “tooth and nail,” for somebody who will give you money for it.
Let Father and your boys take charge of your things at home, prepare for a crop, and make the crop, and you go to work for the best money wages, or in discharge of any debt you owe, that you can get; and, to secure you a fair reward for your labor, I now promise you, that for every dollar you will, between this and the first of May, get for your own labor, either in money or as your own indebtedness, I will then give you one other dollar.
By this, if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month, from me you will get ten more, making twenty dollars a month for your work.
In this I do not mean you shall go off to St. Louis, or the lead mines, or the gold mines in California, but I mean for you to go at it for the best wages you can get close to home in Coles County.
Now, if you will do this, you will be soon out of debt, and, what is better, you will have a habit that will keep you from getting in debt again.
But, if I should now clear you out of debt, next year you would be just as deep in as ever.
You say you would almost give your place in heaven for seventy or eighty dollars.
Then you value your place in heaven very cheap, for I am sure you can, with the offer I make, get the seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months’ work.
You say if I will furnish you the money you will deed me the land, and, if you don’t pay the money back, you will deliver possession.
Nonsense!
If you can’t now live with the land, how will you then live without it?
You have always been kind to me, and I do not mean to be unkind to you.
On the contrary, if you will but follow my advice, you will find it worth more than eighty times eighty dollars to you.
Shelbyville, November 4, 1851.
Dear Brother,
When I came into Charleston day before yesterday, I learned that you are anxious to sell the land where you live and move to Missouri.
I have been thinking of this ever since, and cannot but think such a notion is utterly foolish.
What can you do in Missouri better than here?
Is the land any richer?
Can you there, any more than here, raise corn and wheat and oats without work?
Will anybody there, any more than here, do your work for you?
If you intend to go to work, there is no better place than right where you are; if you do not intend to go to work, you cannot get along anywhere.
Squirming and crawling about from place to place can do no good.
You have raised no crop this year; and what you really want is to sell the land, get the money, and spend it.
Part with the land you have, and, my life upon it, you will never after own a spot big enough to bury you in.
Half you will get for the land you will spend in moving to Missouri, and the other half you will eat, drink, and wear out, and no foot of land will be bought.
Now, I feel it my duty to have no hand in such a piece of foolery.
I feel that it is so even on your own account, and particularly on Mother’s account.
The eastern forty acres I intend to keep for Mother while she lives; if you will not cultivate it, it will rent for enough to support her at least, it will rent for something.
Her dower in the other two forties she can let you have, and no thanks to me.
Now, do not misunderstand this letter; I do not write it in any unkindness.
I write it in order, if possible, to get you to face the truth, which truth is, you are destitute because you have idled away all your time.
Your thousand pretences for not getting along better are all nonsense; they deceive nobody but yourself.
Go to work is the only cure for your case.
A word to Mother.
Chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him.
If I were you I would try it awhile.
If you get tired of it (as I think you will not), you can return to your own home.
Chapman feels very kindly to you, and I have no doubt he will make your situation very pleasant.
Lord Byron to Mr. Murray
Venice, June 8, 1817.
The present letter will be delivered to you by two Armenian friars, on their way, by England, to Madras.
They will also convey some copies of the grammar, which I think you agreed to take.
If you can be of any use to them, either among your naval or East Indian acquaintances, I hope you will so far oblige me, as they and their order have been remarkably attentive and friendly towards me since my arrival at Venice.
Their names are Father Sukias Somalian, and Father Sarkis Theodorosian.
They speak Italian, and probably French, or a little English.
Repeating earnestly my recommendatory request, believe me, Very truly yours, Byron.
P. S. Perhaps you can help them to their passage, or give or get them letters for India.
Notice of a Suspension of Payments.
Dear Sir:
We regret the necessity of informing you that, due to a combination of misfortunes during the past six months and heavy losses incurred through recent failures, we find it beyond our power to meet our engagements, and are this day compelled to suspend payments.
Our books will be written up at once, and as soon as done we shall call a meeting of our creditors and submit a complete statement of our liabilities, and the means we may possess to meet them.
In the meantime we request a suspension of judgment, as we can truthfully claim that our embarrassment has arisen from events which it was impossible to foresee, and over which we had no control.
Successor of a Deceased Storekeeper
Gentlemen:
I hereby inform you that I have succeeded to the business of the late Mr. Jacob Tyler, and intend to deal in exactly the same class of goods, and to open accounts with the firms that have heretofore supplied him.
I was for many years salesman in the house of Messrs. Alford & Co., and those gentlemen will, upon inquiry, inform you in regard to my character and habits.
I inclose the card of a well-known merchant in your city who is well acquainted with my means and resources, and who will furnish you with all the particulars in that respect that you may require.
Should you decide to extend to me the courtesy and confidence heretofore enjoyed by my predecessor, I shall look with pleasant anticipation upon a long and mutually satisfactory business connection.
Inclosed is an order, which, if you are satisfied with my references, kindly execute as promptly as possible.
Very truly yours,
Notice of Partnership Dissolution.
Gentlemen:

Notice of Copartnership Formed.
Gentlemen:
I take pleasure in advising you of the copartnership just formed, between Mr. Arthur Payrian and myself, under the firm name of Garoian & Payrian, for conducting the same business in which I have been singly engaged for the past ten years.
Respectfully soliciting a continuance of your valued patronage for the new firm and thanking you for the confidence reposed in me in the past, I am, very truly yours, Hagop Garoian.
The Answer of an Armenian Agent to an Employer
Gentlemen:
I received your letter of May 10 in regard to procuring some Armenian workmen for your factory.
In reply allow me to state that the prevailing sentiment of Armenians is against working in factories where a strike is in progress.
Armenians need help, and if they are given opportunity to work they gladly welcome it, but they do not wish to hurt the cause of their fellow workers, whose goodwill means much to them.
After the peaceful settlement of the difficulties I shall be glad to send you reliable men for employment.
Thanking you for your letter, I am Yours respectfully,
On Receiving a Favorable Answer.
Dearest Miss ----:
Words cannot express my delight on finding your note on my table last night.
The toils of the day were over, and how delightful it was to find a letter, and such a letter, from one whom I may now hope to hail as the companion of my whole future life!
The weight taken off my mind by the candid and gentle confession of one whose love seemed too great a happiness to hope for, is beyond description.
Tomorrow I shall hasten to the presence of her from whom I hope I may never henceforth be parted; but I could not retire to rest without making one feeble attempt to express my delight at finding that hopes so flattering have not been in vain.
Your devoted and happy lover,
Ordering Goods.
Gentlemen:
We have your letter of June 1, with prices and terms of settlement, for which prompt send an order herewith, relying upon you to supply us with none but first-class articles.
The items I have checked, you will perceive, are those distinguished in your list as being always in stock and ready to hand. These you will please forward immediately; the others as soon as procurable.
Should there have been improvements upon any of the articles, please advise us without delay, holding this order subject to our reply. In the meanwhile, we remain, gentlemen, Yours respectfully,
Preparing to Order Goods.
Gentlemen:
We herewith send you a list of articles, for which you will please favor us with your lowest quotations, informing us at the same time which of them you keep on hand, and the necessary time required for filling an order for such of the others as we may require, together with your customary terms. 
President Lincoln’s Letter to General G. B. McClellan.
Washington, D. C. Feb. 3, 1862.
My dear Sir,
You and I have distinct and different plans for a movement of the Army of the Potomac yours to be down the Chesapeake, up the Rappahannock to Urbana and across land to the terminus of the railroad on the York River; mine to move directly to a point on the railroad southwest of Manassas.
If you will give me satisfactory answers to the following questions, I shall gladly yield my plan to yours.
First. Does not your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure of time and money than mine?
Second. Wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than mine?
Third. Wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than mine?
Fourth. In fact, would it not be less valuable in this, that it would break no great line of the enemy’s communications, while mine would?
Fifth. In case of disaster, would not a retreat be more difficult by your plan than mine?
I have just assisted the Secretary of War in framing part of a despatch to you, relating to army corps, which despatch of course will have reached you long before this will.
I wish to say a few words to you privately on this subject.
I ordered the army corps organization, not only on the unanimous opinion of the twelve generals whom you had selected and assigned as generals of division, but also on the unanimous opinion of every military man I could get an opinion from (and every modern military book), yourself only excepted.
Of course I did not on my own judgment pretend to understand the subject.
I now think it indispensable for you to know how your struggle against it is received in quarters which we cannot entirely disregard.
It is looked upon as merely an effort to pamper one or two pets and to persecute and degrade their supposed rivals.
I have had no word from Sumner, Heintzelman, or Keyes.
The commanders of these corps are of course the three highest officers with you, but I am constantly told that you have no consultation or communication with them,—that you consult and communicate with nobody but General Fitz John Porter, and perhaps General Franklin.
I do not say these complaints are true or just, but at all events it is proper you should know of their existence.
Do the commanders of corps disobey your orders in anything?
... Are you strong enough —are you strong enough, even with my help— to set your foot upon the necks of Sumner, Heintzelman, and Keyes, all at once?
This is a practical and a very serious question for you.
Proposing to Open an Account
Gentlemen:
We beg to open a credit account with you in favor of Mr. A. H., who will hand you this.
Any sums he may require, not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) in the aggregate, you will please advance to him, charging the amount to our account.
Yours truly,
Proposing to Open an Account.
Gentlemen:
As we are desirous of opening business relations with your house, we shall ask you to transmit a list of prices, stating your terms of settlement.
Business increases rapidly, and we are in a position, with our facilities, for handling a large quantity of your style of goods.
As to our standing, we are permitted to refer to Messrs. Israel Knapp & Co., of our city, and Messrs. Hopkins & Lathers, bankers, of your own.
Hoping to hear from you at an early date, we remain, gentlemen, Yours truly,
Relating to the Payment of a Mortgage.
Dear Sir:
The note for $2500, for the security of which you hold a mortgage deed on my house and lot, No 12 Scranton Street, is payable on the first of next month.
After that date I understand that you can, if you choose, at once bring suit for foreclosure.
It is not in my power to raise the sum necessary to discharge the debt, and I should be greatly obliged for information as to your intentions on the subject.
As you know, I have always paid the interest regularly, and I enclose herewith a check for the last quarter ($37.50) payable to your order.
You are probably aware that I have a small but regular income and am certain to keep up the interest.
Under these circumstances I have great hopes that you will allow matters to stand as they are at the present.
Yours respectfully,
Requesting a Loan from a Friend.
Dear Marcar:
Can you oblige me with a loan of twenty-five dollars for a couple of weeks, as I have unexpectedly run short of funds?
By that time I shall be in good shape financially, and you may depend upon the return of the money by the middle of the month.
I shall be glad to hear from you at any time that I may do you a similar favor.
Trusting that you may be in a position to help me out, As ever, yours, Hovsep.
Refusing to Make a Loan.
Dear Sir:
I am sorry that circumstances will not permit me to meet the demands of a friend in whom I am so interested; but I am myself in great need of money, and only a few days ago was forced to borrow to meet a note.
It is, therefore, out of my power to grant your request.
Regretting my inability to aid you, and trusting that you may be successful in securing the money, I am Yours very truly,
Granting a Loan.
Dear Sir:
Your letter of September 7 is received, and I am glad to be able to say that you may have the loan asked for.
Inclosed you will find a check for the amount, which you may return at your own convenience.
Yours very sincerely,
From an Employee Requesting Increase of Salary.
Gentlemen:
Requesting an indulgent view of my application, I most respectfully ask for an increase of my salary, beginning Jan. 1, next.
I am prepared to demonstrate to your satisfaction: the grounds upon which I desire this increase, and can assure you that, should you accede to my request, I shall do my utmost to merit a continuance of your confidence and interest in me as your employee.
I am at present receiving twenty-two dollars a week, and would much appreciate a raise to twenty-five dollars.
Hoping to receive a favorable answer, I am Yours respectfully,
My Dear E.:
I verily believe, my dear E., that the pure, genuine feelings of love are as rare in the world as the pure, genuine principles of virtue and piety.
This I hope will account for the uncommon style of all my letters to you.
By uncommon, I mean their being written in such a serious manner, which, to tell you truth, has made me often afraid lest you should take me for some zealous bigot, who conversed with his mistress as he would converse with his minister.
I don’t know how it is, my dear, for though, except your company, there is nothing on earth gives me so much pleasure as writing to you, yet it never gives me those giddy raptures so much talked of among lovers.
I have often thought that if a well-grounded affection be not really a part of virtue, ’tis something extremely akin to it.
Whenever the thought of my E. warms my heart, every feeling of humanity, every principle of generosity kindles in my breast.
It extinguishes every dirty spark of malice and envy which are but too apt to infest me.
I grasp every creature in the arms of universal benevolence, and equally participate in the pleasures of the happy, and sympathize with the miseries of the unfortunate.
I assure you, my dear, I often look up to the Divine Disposer of events with an eye of gratitude for the blessing which I hope he intends to bestow on me in bestowing you.
I sincerely wish that he may bless my endeavors to make your life as comfortable and happy as possible, both in sweetening the rougher parts of my natural temper, and bettering the unkindly circumstances of my fortune.
This, my dear, is a passion, at least in my view, worthy of a man, and I will add worthy of a Christian.
The sordid earthworm may profess love to a woman’s person, whilst in reality his affection is centered in her pocket; and the slavish drudge may go awooing as he goes to the horse market to choose one who is stout and firm, and as we may say of an old horse, one who will be a good drudge and draw kindly.
I disdain their dirty, puny ideas. I would be heartily out of humor with myself if I thought I were capable of having so poor a notion of the sex, which were designed to crown the pleasures of society.
Poor devils! I don’t envy them their happiness who have such notions.
For my part, I propose quite other pleasures with my dear partner.
I do not remember, in the course of your acquaintance and mine, ever to have heard your opinion on the ordinary way of falling in love, amongst people of our station of life: I do not mean the persons who proceed in the way of bargain, but those whose affection is really placed on the person.
Though I be, as you know very well, but a very awkward lover myself, yet as I have some opportunities of observing the conduct of others who are much better skilled in the affair of courtship than I am, I often think it is owing to lucky chance more than to good management, that there are not more unhappy marriages than usually are.
It is natural for a young fellow to like the acquaintance of the females, and customary for him to keep their company when occasion serves: some one of them is more agreeable to him than the rest; there is something, he knows not what, pleases him, he knows not how, in her company.
This I take to be what is called love with the greater part of us; and I must own, dear E., it is a hard game, such a one as you have to play when you meet with such a lover.
You cannot refuse but he is sincere, and yet though you use him ever so favorably, perhaps in a few months, or at farthest in a year or two, the same unaccountable fancy may make him as distractedly fond of another, whilst you are quite forgot.
I am aware that perhaps the next time I have the pleasure of seeing you, you may bid me take my own lesson home, and tell me that the passion I have professed for you is perhaps one of those transient flashes I have been describing; but I hope, my dear E., you will do me the justice to believe me, when I assure you that the love I have for you is founded on the sacred principles of virtue and honor, and by consequence so long as you continue possessed of those amiable qualities which first inspired my passion for you, so long must I continue to love you.
Believe me, my dear, it is love like this alone which can render the marriage state happy.
People may talk of flames and raptures as long as they please, and a warm fancy, with a flow of youthful spirits, may make them feel something like what they describe; but sure I am the nobler faculties of mind, with kindred feelings of the heart, can only be the foundation of friendship, and it has always been my opinion that the married life was only friendship in a more exalted degree.
If you will be so good as to grant my wishes, and it should please Providence to spare us to the latest period of life, I can look forward and see that even then, though bent down with wrinkled age: even then, when all other worldly circumstances will be indifferent to me, I will regard my E. with the tenderest affection, and for this plain reason, because she is still possessed of those noble qualities, improved to a much higher degree, which first inspired my affection for her.
“O! happy state when souls each other draw, When love is liberty and nature law.”
I know were I to speak in such a style to many a girl, who thinks herself possessed of no small share of sense, she would think it ridiculous; but the language of the heart is, my dear E., the only courtship I shall ever use to you.
When I look over what I have written, I am sensible it is vastly different from the ordinary style of courtship, but I shall make no apology,  I know your good nature will excuse what your good sense may see amiss.
Sending Money to His Father.
Dear Father,
This is my happiest hour since I came to America, because I now have an opportunity to send you a little token of my filial affection.
I have been working for the last four weeks, and now I enclose my first savings, a check for two English pounds, which you may cash at the Ottoman Bank.
My work is not very hard; only, being always on my feet, I get tired and my ankles ache.
If I were walking until evening I could stand it better. But I am getting used to it.
Uncle tells me that before the end of two months I shall be entirely accustomed to it.
At present I can save a little over a couple of dollars a week.
I hope that after learning the work well I shall be able to double my earnings.
After I am accustomed to the work I shall go to evening school to learn English. Uncle does not want me to go now as I still feel the fatigue of my work and my feet have not stopped aching.
Give my love to all relatives.
Your grateful son, Melkon.
Another Letter to the Sister.
Dear Sister Vartouhi,
I have already given you some information in regard to American life.
I like to write you of whatever I see or whatever attracts my attention.
Being still a newcomer and busy with a long day’s work I have no chance to look around.
For a week I have been attending evening school to take lessons in English composition. At the same time I am practicing speaking.
After learning the language I hope I shall be able to better understand American ways and manners and give you more information.
At present whatever I write you has to do with the outward aspects of life.
This year is the presidential election year in the United States.
Although my ears are not very familiar with the language, I have gone to listen to every political speech.
I have not been able to get much out of them, but when I have seen them published the next day in the daily papers I have been able to read them with the help of a dictionary and get some idea of them.
There are seven political parties. Those which deserve attention are the following in the order of their strength: Democratic, Republican, Progressive, and Socialist.
The Progressive has been recently organized after separating from the Republican party.
The political campaign has been intense, with newspaper discussion, public speeches, parades, etc.
Some night parades were worth seeing.
One night I saw a students’ parade.
The students from several colleges had formed a huge parade in honor of the candidate with whom they had party affiliation, and, with bands of music, torches, flags, and varied costumes, they marched in the streets of Boston.
The torches from a distance gave the impression of a mass of flames, and when the parade came nearer they illuminated the streets like daylight.
A multitude of men and women were spectators of this beautiful scene and cheered the paraders with prolonged “Hurrays”.
Sometimes there were witty allusions on their banners, and when appreciating spectators saw them they responded with cheers.
When the parade approached a place an outcry of greetings filled the air; and when something witty on the brilliant banners was read an uproar of cheers and laughter echoed everywhere.
Such shouts and noise were continuously repeated by the successive crowds.
How I wished that you were with me to see and enjoy these with me!
I cannot describe all of them.
Last night the elections were over.
In the evening we went to Boston in order to see the results of the elections in front of the newspaper buildings, where the outcome was represented by moving pictures.
This morning the papers announce that the Democrats have come out victorious and that the election of Mr. Wilson is secured.
The President is not elected by the direct vote of the people.
The latter elect, in their respective states, a number of men who come together on one day in January in the capital of their state and vote for the president.
Americans call the meetings of these electors the Electoral College.
The president is thus nominally elected by the Electoral College, but in fact by the people; because the members of the Electoral College vote for the candidate of their respective parties.
Therefore today they can tell by the elected electors who will be the next president.
I obtained this information from the teacher in the evening school who repeated it to me several times until I understood what he said.
I hope you will be glad to know how Americans elect their president.
Uncle was glad to read your letter. He will write to you himself.
Remember me to all our relatives.
I shall not be able to write another letter today.
Your affectionate brother,
The Sister’s Answer.
Dear Brother:
I read with great joy and interest your letter of Nov. 6th, in which you gave information in regard to the elections in the United States.
I thank you, dear brother, for your kind consideration.
You say that you wish I were with you.
I appreciate that brotherly thought; I myself desire very much to be with you. But, as I cannot be with you to help you and enjoy American life with you, I get from your letter interesting information and knowledge.
Dear Brother, you cannot imagine how happy such letters make us, the Armenian girls, who are afraid to go out of the house and cannot find books at home to read.
Your letters give me an outlook on the world and I read them just like stories.
They make home a school for me.
I read your letters to my girl friends and they said that I must be very happy in having such a brother.
I am embroidering a sofa pillow cover. I will send it to you as a keepsake as soon as I get through.
Give my love to Uncle.
Your loving sister,
Sending Money to His Friend
Dear ..., 
The winter has already gone.
Sunny and long days have succeeded stormy and short days.
In winter I longed for sunshine, because I had to go to my work before the sunrise and stay there until dark.
Now I enjoy the cheerful morning light before I go to the shop, and in the evening I often go to the seashore before it gets dark.
I promised to send you money for your jour ney to America, and now I am happy in keeping my word.
I am very anxious to send this letter to you, therefore I shall not lose time in attempting to write a long one.
You will find enclosed a check for forty English pounds, which is more than enough for a comfortable trip in the second cabin.
When you arrive at New York we shall take care of you.
Wherever you land on your way drop a line to me.
It is easy for you to arrange your trip for Marseilles.
But you must be careful after that.
At Marseilles go to a clean hotel.
Unfortunately Armenian hotels have left a good deal to be desired.
Of course you will have your eyes examined before you start to be sure that there is nothing wrong.
I shall write to Mr. K., one of the Armenian agents, to help you in every way.
In sending you this little sum I do not intend to make you my debtor.
My purpose is to help you as I think it my duty to do.
So don’t worry about having a debt. Whenever you are able to pay it without vexation you may.
If you succeed in your pursuit and fail to pay me this sum I shall feel more rewarded than to have you pay it back and see you deprived of your ideals.
Hoping to see you very soon, I am,
Yours,

Very respectfully yours,
The Letter of an Unsuccessful but Brave Man.
Dear ...,
I have not written you for a long time.
When I received your last letter I was still entertaining bright hopes.
Three years have passed since, and I fail to see any good prospect.
I did not write to you for so long, because I wanted and waited to write some news of success.
It is harder for me to inform you of failure than it is to bear it.
Now I break the silence simply because I do not want to prolong it any longer.
I am not bitter at my lack of success. I do not believe some hostile fortune persecutes me.
It is simply that circumstances have not been favorable.
I rather blame myself for my failure to come out victorious. However, I have not yet come to the conclusion that I owe my failure to my incapacity.
When I analyze the difficulties that I have had to confront I feel proud of my failure.
I do not regret my enterprises either. What I did I ought to have done, and I tried to do well.
Therefore I feel as proud over the unsuccessful outcome as a brave soldier would feel of his wounds after a hard but lost fight.
My strength has not yet deserted me; I will continue the fight to the very end.
I hope you will forgive me for my long silence and that you will write good long letters, full of the fun and cheerful jokes of the old days.
Your old friend,
Dear ————-:
You are waiting for a letter and some news.
I do not know what to write about or what information to give.
Before I came to America I felt curiosity about everything, but now I have no interest in anything.
My life here has been a series of failures and disappointments.
After arriving here I was without work for several months. Then I was given a chance in a factory, where I worked about a year. I had hardly paid my debts when the factory closed.
The work did not require much training, so I am still an unskilled laborer and find it hard to get work.
My friends advised me to learn engraving, hoping that after six months’ training I might earn twenty dollars a week.
With great difficulty I found a place where the man at the head was willing to teach me the business in a year.
His conditions were: no pay for the first two months, three dollars a week during the third and fourth months, and during the remaining eight months seven dollars a week in average.
I agreed and began my work, incurred some new debts to meet my weekly expenses, and after four months’ experience could hardly support myself, although living in a most economical way.
At the end of the year the man was not willing to pay more than eight dollars a week, so I gave up the work.
I looked for a job in other places and wandered for months from one city to another. Meanwhile I forgot what I had learned. In a few places they took me in for a trial, but the work they gave me was in branches of engraving which I had not learned, so they discharged me.
After five or six months’ wandering word came from a place that there was an opening at fifteen dollars a week, with the promise of raising to twenty dollars in a short time.
But I soon learned that there was a strike there and they wanted to employ me as a scab until they were out of their difficulties.
Dear ——, although poor I am proud.
I did not want the piece of bread which I must snatch from some one else’s hand.
I preferred dying of starvation to betraying the cause of others.
I had no aptitude for such baseness․
Finally I got a chance to work on railroads.
I was the only Armenian among a hundred Italians.
There wasn’t much money in it.
The work day was nine and a half hours. By working three hours overtime, twelve and a half hours a day, I could make sixteen dollars a week.
I worked a few months, cleared away my debts, and when we got through with the work I had about forty dollars left in my pocket.
Now I am again without work.
I am still looking for a position in engraving, but can’t find any.
I intend now to learn a branch in shoe manufacturing.
How I regret leaving the old home!
I looked with contempt upon the articles against emigration.
How happy I would be if I could go back, take the old spade and hoe, work on that little piece of land left from my forefathers, and earn a livelihood enjoying the tender affection of my mother and sister!
That life seems to me a dream.
I expect a good long letter from you.
I am sorry that I could not write a more cheerful letter than this.
Yours as ever,
The Letter of a Man Without Work.
Dear ... ,
The days go by, one week succeeds another and I already count six months in this strange land.
I am lonely among millions of people and live without comfort.
No work and no hope of a living.
I have learned the language a little, and now I can, right or wrong, express myself. Hard life has made me bold and smart; I go to different places to apply for work, but in vain. 
Don’t laugh at me if I tell you that I succeed in finding some work when it snows. I clear the sidewalks of snow and get twenty cents an hour!
Unfortunately it doesn’t snow every day.
What a contrast between extreme poverty and extreme wealth in this country!
When I walk in the streets of the city I see enormous buildings that stand with pride, their roofs high in the sky as if they would touch the clouds.
Mechanically I begin to count the stories: one, two, three, four, five, six: and before I reach the tenth I confuse the windows.
I begin to count again and I go as far as fourteen and sixteen.
Constructions of ten stories are common.
Other cities have buildings twice as high.
One day while walking aimlessly in one of the suburbs, I went to the top of a nearby hill, from which, for the first time I saw the horizon far and wide.
The city and its suburbs were before me in their broad expanse. I eagerly gazed at the monuments of human labor which lay silently outspread.
I could see countless chimneys pointing their tops to the sky and puffing up volumes of black smoke, piles of clouds which gradually dissolved and disappeared in space.
A hazy atmosphere covered the whole city.
It was a sign that the fire of civilization was burning in the city, turning machines, while thousands of hands in unison with the machines were habitually moving and producing.
But in all these activities there was neither room nor a share for me.
I gazed at this view for hours. I tried to think, but could not. It seemed to me I was living in a dream.
That day my discouragement was greater.
I returned with a bitterness which I cannot describe.
On my way I saw men passing fast in automobiles; I felt myself reduced to such insignificance that I thought I was a useless existence crawling around.
I am afraid my letter is full of selfishness. Instead of giving you information I have described my difficulties.
Pardon me. My heart was full of things which I had kept to myself. Now, in writing them to you, I feel relieved.
Write me oftener. Your letters comfort me in my loneliness.
Yours as ever,
The Letter of a Sick Man.
Dear friend, 
I was bearing my somewhat adverse lot in life with uncomplaining patience and cheerful indifference.
Believing in my physical endurance and impelled by the pressure of need I worked hard, not refusing overtime night work.
And now I learn with stoical indifference that nature, that rather severe judge of ours, has given me warning of serious punishment. At least, this is the testimony of the doctor.
Now, in order to give the assurance of my humble submission, I write this letter and solemnly promise that I shall cheerfully rest and walk until I consume my money, and I shall pay my daily devotions at the temple of Nature.
Of course, my parents will suffer on account of this sin of mine, because I shall not be able to give them my regular assistance.
The doctor assures me that after five or six weeks of absolute rest, walks in the open air, and pleasant recreation all danger will be passed and I shall be able to resume my daily work with certain precautions.
By simple arithmetic I find that the penalty imposed upon me by nature will be just equal to my earnings from overtime night work.
I have money enough to pay the penalty.
Therefore, considering myself a millionaire, I will observe that sweet penance of open air — which is imposed upon me.
There is nothing to worry about.
If, after this positive evidence of my most humble submission, the judge refuses to forgive me — which is not probable — then I shall leave to you the difficult task of consoling my parents. Don’t say anything to them yet. I shall explain my not sending money with the excuse of lack of work.
You see that I have not lost my cheerful disposition.
I would not complain even if I had reached a dangerous stage.
Therefore cheer up yourself and write me good letters, which, I assure you, will supply the chief charm of my open air exercises.
Greetings of love from Your old chum,
The Answer.
Dear ...,
At first your letter gave me a terrible shock, but that sweet disposition which showed itself throughout your letter comforted me and gave me the assurance of your recovery.
I cannot help admiring the manly spirit and noble pride which prevent you from calling yourself a sick man.
Trusting that such a brave and cheerful spirit cannot be overcome by any sickness, I share your gayety with you. 
The only disquieting circumstance for you in this case may be the financial loss; but you do not care for that, and must not worry about your parents. You have your friends who admire you and will gladly give you any assistance that they can.
I read your letter in the circle of our friends. All express the same admiration and urge with solicitude that you prolong the period of your rest in order —as you wittily remark— to make your penance of open air more acceptable to “judge nature”.
We sang sweet songs for you, praised your bravery, and sent many good wishes by the wireless telegraphy of hearts.
We owe our joyful reunion to your sunny letter.
I can find no words to convey all our thoughts, but as a weak expression of our comradeship and love we sign collectively and severally the adjoining document, which bears a line from each of us.
Waiting for happy news, I am, Yours very truly,
Threatening Law Proceedings.
I have waited patiently for three months to receive payment of your bill for groceries and provisions purchased of me.
The last item was bought February 10, and it is now the middle of July.
The bill has been sent to you several times, but has met with no response.
I am obliged to inform you that if payment is not made before the first of next month, I shall put the account into the hands of an attorney for collection.
Yours sincerely,
To an Acquaintance of Long Standing.
My dear Miss ...,
I have so long enjoyed the happiness of being received as a welcome guest at your respected parents’ house, that I write with the more confidence on a subject of most serious importance to my welfare.
From constantly meeting with you and observing the thousand acts of amiability and kindness which adorn your daily life, I have gradually associated my hopes of future happiness with the chance of possessing you as their sharer.
Believe me, dear Miss —————, this is no outbreak of boyish passion, but the hearty and healthy result of a long and affectionate study of your disposition.
It is love, founded on esteem; and I feel persuaded that your knowledge of my own character will lead you to trace my motives to their right source.
May I, then, implore you to consult your own heart, and, should I not have been mistaken in the happy belief that my feelings are in some measure reciprocated, to grant me permission to mention the matter to your parents.
Yours faithfully,
My dear Emmy,
I use that name because, though you are now a woman, I can only think of you as the “little Emmy” of the many happy days of childhood that we have spent together.
Can you make up  your mind to listen to a very awful confession?
In plain words, I love you as heartily now as ever, and, if I may judge from our last night’s meeting after so long a separation, you have not quite lost the remembrance of your old playfellow.
But, joking apart, Time has done much for both of us; for you, in making you all that can be desired by man as the object of his love and trust; for me, in enabling me to provide a home for her who has ever been dearest to me, and whose image has never faded from my memory amidst the varied exertions of a hard career.
And now, my dear Emmy, think well whether you can give me that affection as a woman which, in your girlhood, was my chiefest delight.
We shall meet on —— at ——’s, and then, perhaps, my heart may be gladdened by a belief that “there is something in first loves.”
Eagerly awaiting our meeting, believe me, Your affectionate old playmate and new lover,
Dearest Katharine:
How sad it is that I am hindered from being with you on this dearest of all days of the year, the day that gave my Katharine to the light, and that laid the foundation of the greatest happiness of my life.
Words cannot express the deep gratitude I feel to that Power, which, in granting you life, has at the same time, year after year, ripened the graces of the soul as well as developed the outward perfections of the body.
As I see you, the companion of my childish pains and pleasures, expanding into the woman who is to share both with me throughout my future lot, I feel almost surprised as to how I have deserved such happiness, and gratitude beyond expression to the kind parents who have encouraged and approved our affection.
Accept, dearest, the enclosed portrait.
I feel that its original is too deeply stamped on your heart to require an effigy to remind you of him.
It is, however, the most appropriate present I could offer to the cause of my happiness on this brightest of all days.
God grant that every succeeding year may see you increase in all that is charming in body and mind!
Believe me, dearest Katharine,
Since I met with you, my mind has been constantly filled with the remembrance of the pleasant moments passed in your society.
My business has been improving of late, and in point of prosperity I have much cause to be thankful.
But I feel that there are higher duties in life than can be fulfilled by man in his single state, and I am anxious to find a companion for my future life.
Such a companion, dear Miss —-———, I venture to believe I have found in you, and my earnest hope is, that you may be willing to accept the affectionate regard of one who, however humble in his present position, has every desire to elevate that position for your sake.
Without my attempting to use fine language, or make a parade of sentiment, I hope you will receive these lines as conveying the plain and honest sentiments of one who, in anxious expectation of your reply, remains, dear Miss ————, 
Your most devoted servant,
My dearest ...,
If there is one thing which can console me for my unavoidable absence from your side, it is the pleasure of being able to pen a few lines to express, however feebly, my continued and increasing affection for you.
It is, indeed, a painful and irksome change from our rambles about the fields, our evening duets, and our stolen conversations, to a dull routine of mercantile accounts and the never-ending confusion of business.
Happily, however, my affairs are in a rapid state of settlement, and I shall soon hope once more to bask in the sunshine of my Fanny’s sweet countenance, and to feed my imagination with thoughts of the happiness her placid and sincere dispositon will hereafter shed around a home!
I need hardly say how eagerly I watch for the post, and how I cherish every line that bears the evidence of my dear girl’s affection, and how gratefully every sentiment that flows from her pen is treasured in my memory.
God bless you, dearest ——-, and may you believe me, with most respectful and affectionate remembrances to your parents and all friends,
To the Father of a Lady.
Respected Sir,
I venture to hope that you will call all your friendly feelings to my assistance in considering a proposal I am about to lay before you, in which my happiness is much concerned.
For a long time past your daughter ——— has held a strong hold over my affections, and I have reason to believe that I am not indifferent to her.
My position is such as to warrant my belief that I could support her in the style of comfort which she so well deserves, and which it has been your constant aim to provide for your children.
As regards my character and disposition, I trust they are sufficiently well known to you to give you confidence in the prospect of your child’s happiness.
I have not, however, ventured on any express declaration of my feelings without first consulting you on the subject; as I feel persuaded that the straightforward course is always the best, and that a parent’s sanction will never be wanting when the circumstances of the case justify its being accorded.
Anxiously awaiting the result of your consideration on this important subject, I remain, Sir, Yours very respectfully,
The Answer.
My dear ...,
I thank you very much for the manly and honorable way in which you have addressed me in reference to my daughter’s hand.
I have long since perceived that your attentions to her were of a marked character, and that they appeared to give her much pleasure.
I know of no reason for opposing your wishes, and if I may judge from the manner in which my daughter received the communication from myself, you will find a by no means unwilling listener.
Dine with us tomorrow at ——, if you are not engaged, and you will then have an opportunity of pleading your own cause.
Meanwhile, believe me, with full confidence in your integrity and good feeling,
Yours most sincerely,
Unfavorable on Account of a Pre-engagement.
Dear Sir,
It is always painful to return an unfavorable answer, but such is unfortunately my task on the present occasion.
My daughter has for a long time been engaged to a gentleman whose character and position give her no cause to regret the tie.
At the same time she duly appreciates the compliment implied by your preference and unites with me in the sincere wish that, as an esteemed friend, you may meet with a companion in every way calculated to ensure your happiness.
Victor Hugo to His Little Didine.
Good morning, my pet; good morning, my dear little girlie.
I promised to write to you. You see I am keeping my word.
I have seen the sea, some fine churches, and some pretty country.
The sea is large, the churches are handsome, the country is pretty; but the country is not as pretty as you; the churches are not as handsome as your Mamma, and the sea is not as great as my love for you all.
My pet, I have often given half-pence to poor children walking barefooted by the roadside, for your sakes, my little ones.
I love you all dearly.
A few hours more and I shall be kissing you on your two dear little cheeks, and also my Charlie and my little Dede, who will give me a smile, I hope, and my beloved Toto.
Good-by for the present, my Didine.
Keep this letter.
When you are grown up, I shall be old, you will show it to me, we shall love each other dearly; when you are old you will show it to your children, and they will love you as much as I do.
We shall soon meet.
Your own daddy,
Valenciennes, 15th August, 1837.
The church bells are pealing as I arrive in this town.
It is the fete of the Virgin.
I dedicate it to you, my child.
I did not wish to let this day go by without writing to you, my beloved Didine.
Not a day, not an hour passes without my thinking of you.
Your mother, you, your brother, and your dear little sister are always in my thoughts, and united to me in the same love.
Did you get my last little scrawl?
Did you like it, my Didine?
Keep it for my sake.
Above all, keep your innocence and your kind heart, your reverence for God and for your mother, your simple mind, and constant desire to do right; in so doing you will some day, like your mother, unite the virtues of the woman to the innocence of the child.
To get here, I had to pass through lovely country, green and covered with flowers, which made me think of God; I spoke to Him of you, of all of you, my dear ones, whom I have left behind me.
Kiss all those I love who are around you for me, beginning with your mother.
Your own daddy, V.
For My Charlie.
Mayence, 1st Oct., 1838.
My dear old Charlie:
You must write me a good long letter (to Treves), beginning it early and finishing it late.
You know how much I love you, dear child.
I must have a long letter from you.
You must also write a little diary for me telling me how you have spent your time at Saint-Pris during the holidays, and if, as I hope, you have prepared for next year’s work amid your play and leisure time.
I want you, my dear Charlie, to be a good, hardworking boy, and an industrious scholar.
Talking of this reminds me that in one of my letters I gave you an exercise to write.
Neither you nor Toto have sent it to me.
Now that the holidays are nearly over, and you have only a few days left to play, I will let you off this exercise.
If you have read my letters, dear Charlie, you will know what I mean by The Cat and the Mouse.
The Cat is for Toto, and the Mouse for you.
In my drawing they are quite unlike nature, the mouse is much larger and much fiercer than the cat.
The day I was drawing it, the sky in which it was disappearing was stormy and lowering.
You will notice at the foot of the adjoining mountain the face of a giant with his mouth open.
I drew this very carefully.
Your giant is an excellent likeness.
I do all this with pleasure, dear children, for your sakes, to amuse you and make you happy.
My pleasures of the moment, as well as the work of all my life, are for you.
I am not sure what state the drawings I send you will arrive in.
The ink one gets at inns loses its color from one day to another in the most tiresome way.
I have worked hard during the holidays, dear Charlie; I hope that you have done the same too, a little.
You have been always in my thoughts, my dear old boy; I hope that you have thought of your daddy, who loves you as dearly as, nay more than, his life, and who kisses you on both your nice cheeks. 
V.
Cannes, 8th Oct., (1839).
Here are four sketches for you, four, my Didine.
I send you the Strasburg Cathedral to match that of Reims; to Charlie, a view of a splendid old tower, surrounded by the sea, on the Island of Saint Honorat, two leagues from here (I have written the story of the tower at the side of the drawing); to Toto, the view of a suburb of Bale, taken from the Cathedral Square; and to Dede, a few pretty Baden houses, with the town gate.
I hope you will all be pleased with them, and then, when I get home, I will do some more sketches for those who have come off worst.
I am the best off, after all, because I feel the pleasure I am giving you more than you do.
Those mountains behind the spire of Strasburg are the Black Forest.
This is a beautiful spot; I came to it to see the prison of the Man with the Iron Mask.
I have also seen the Gulf Juan, where Napoleon landed in 1815.
I start for Paris the day after tomorrow.
I shall get there by the 18th or 19th.
Kiss your dear good mother for me.
Tell her I count on getting a letter from her at Chalon-sur-Saone.
I had begun a long letter to her, but your drawings prevented me from finishing it.
She will get it soon.
You are back at school again, Charlie.
Work hard, be as good a scholar as you are a good boy, and love your father, who is always thinking of you.
I will enclose a letter for you in the next I write to your mother.
Goodbye for the present, my darling Charlie.
We shall meet soon, my Toto.
I have been at sea for the last fortnight.
I have learned how to steer a sailing boat, to make plain knots, gasket knots, running knots, etc.
I will show you all my accomplishments in Paris.
You are now at school; you must work hard too, my pet.
My Dede, I love you.
You love Papa very much, don’t you?
I wanted to pick up some shells for you here; but I could not find any.
There is nothing but sand, which is ridiculous.
We shall meet soon, Mamma; very soon, my Adele.
Write me a nice letter, a really nice letter.
I love you, and I shall love you still more if you will send me some loving and tender words, which I am longing for.
As to the rent, tell M. Bellanger I will pay it when I come back, about the 18th or 19th.
Kiss me, my Adele, and be happy, for I am devotedly attached to you.
I embrace you all, my darlings.
Your father, V.
