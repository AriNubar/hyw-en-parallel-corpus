14 years have passed since the assassination of Hrant Dink. Editor of the newspaper "Agos" about Hrant Dink and friendship with him
14 years have passed since the assassination of Hrant Dink, an Istanbul-Armenian journalist and editor-in-chief of the “Agos” newspaper.
Dink's close friend Pakrat Estukyan still remembers their first meeting, they were both 20 years old, they did not even imagine that in the coming years they would become close friends.
“During the founding of the “Agos” newspaper we became much closer, we had a very close relationship, shared ideas, consulted before “Agos” was published.
And when “Agos” was founded, I was already one of his best friends."
Thanks to the publication of the newspaper, the friends managed to organize a large-scale protest demanding to prevent the illegal privatization of the Mkhitarist College which belonged to the Armenian community.
“As a result of this struggle, they abandoned that idea. An official decision was made to continue the education.
Hrant and I started to sweep the garden, and at that moment we were photographed, it was one of the best moments in my life."
The Armenian journalist from Istanbul faced many difficulties in his work.
Dink was one of those people who talked about everything that others were silent about.
“First of all, the Armenians' demand for justice in Turkey, the fact of the Genocide.
“Hrant did all this without any feeling of hatred within himself for the Turks, Hrant did not hate, he just wanted to make the Turks accept the historical reality."
Pakrat Estukyan said that Hrant Dink knew that he was in danger.
On January 19, 2007, the body of the assassinated Istanbul-Armenian journalist was found in front of the “Agos” editorial office.
“For the first time in my life, a wave of racism swept over me, for the first time in my life I felt the illness which is called anti-Turkish hatred.
At that time, my only desire was to meet a Turk who would say something opposite in order to conflict with him.
I was full of hatred for the Turks that day."
After the assassination of Hrant Dink, a protest march was organized in Turkey.
The large procession with the slogan “We are all Armenians, we are all Hrant” reached the editorial office of “Agos”.
Following the incident, 17-year-old Ogun Samast was arrested and charged with murder; he admitted he was guilty.
Meanwhile, Bagrat Estukyan claims that Dink's assassination was a state crime, and the court is concealing the reality.
The trial of the assassination of the Istanbul-Armenian journalist continues to this day.
182 million drams for teachers' training
The government continues reforms in the field of education.
It is planned to allocate 182 million drams for teacher training.
The Acting Minister of Education, Science, Culture and Sports emphasized that in this way they increase the number of certified teachers:
“It is expected that in the next two years not only the teachers subject to certification will be certified, numbering about 7.400 teachers, but also the teachers who did not participate in the process in the previous two years,” said Dumanyan.
Acting Deputy Prime Minister, Tigran Avinyan, mentioned that within the framework of these reforms, first of all, teachers’ salaries have been reviewed, and the renovation works of educational institutions are being actively carried out:
“Significant overhaul of infrastructure in the field of public education is underway right now.
Out of 129 capital renovation and construction projects took place this year, 105 of which are educational institutions,” Avinyan said.
Judicial and legal reform programs are also ongoing.
Two separate chambers will be created: civil and administrative:
“The draft also regulates the issues related to the formation and normal functioning of the civil and administrative chambers of the Court of Cassation.
It is planned to develop flexible mechanisms for filling the lists of candidates for judges and candidates to be promoted, without limiting the terms and the number to be filled,” said First Deputy Minister of Justice Kristiné Grigoryan.
The Civil Chamber will have 7 judges, and the Administrative Chamber will have 5 judges.
According to Kristiné Grigorian, with such a strategy of reforms, they focus on different spheres and try to increase the efficiency of the judicial system.
19-year-old Siranush came as a volunteer, completed military training and stayed in her homelandFrom Russia to Armenia as a volunteer.
Siranush Ghukasyan returned to her homeland in the first days of the war.
She joined a volunteer training camp in Yerevan and completed military training.
How to climb, hit the enemy, rescue a wounded friend - all this 19-year-old repatriate learned from dawn till dusk.
“We studied so much that if someone woke me up at night and asked a question, I could tell everything with my eyes closed.
I just wanted to go to the front line and protect my home so that they would not reach it, so that my home would remain behind my back” - Siranush said.
The repatriated young girl also learned to provide first aid and passed on her skills and knowledge to young conscripts.
Siranush said that the war has changed a lot of things in her life: values, goals, plans: “Now I think that after us there should come a generation that will not have the idea that they were defeated or subjected to genocide.
Nzhdeh said that even if you are weak, show your strength so that the enemy is afraid to attack you.
We must strive not only to show, but to be so strong."
Siranush Ghukasyan imagines her future in Armenia and wants to raise her children in the homeland.

6 captured Armenian servicemen were equipping and mining the border: Nikol Pashinyan
Acting Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated during the government session that 6 Armenian servicemen captured from the border area of the Gegharkunik region were carrying out mining works on the state border.
“That is, they were not made for subversive purposes, but were carried out in a mining work, and warning signs were placed in parallel about the area being mined,” Pashinyan said.
According to Nikol Pashinyan, these actions were carried out in order to increase the level of border protection.
He said that the circumstances of the captivity of the servicemen have yet to be clarified.
“One thing is clear. In fact, it is not captivity, rather an abduction of our servicemen from the territory of the Republic of Armenia.
Incidents like this happen because some people want us to accept the presence of the Azerbaijani forces on our territory, which cannot happen,” he said.
According to the acting prime minister, the servicemen had an engineering problem with equipping the border, which is constantly happening along the border.
Pashinyan emphasized that this issue should not be used for internal political purposes.
“We should condemn all attempts to use this situation against the army and the armed forces, because the servicemen and the army are fulfilling their function of protecting the borders of Armenia,” Pashinyan said.
According to Nikol Pashinyan, all sides, including international levers, should be used to resolve the situation.

Christine Movsisyan, a representative of the Armenian community of the city of Jaffa and founder of the center, is very pleased with this event.
According to her, this will give an opportunity to unite even more.
“We have students 8-15 years old and 15-60 years old.
They want to study our alphabet, literature, find out what holidays we have.
There are very few of us, Armenians, in Israel and we are scattered all over the country.
We had to do so that we became a family here.
Whenever I meet Armenians, I take contacts and invite them to classes.
They come with pleasure.
We have the printed alphabet, we open the textbooks and start studying” - said the founder of the center in an interview with “Hayern Aysor”.
According to Christine Movsisyan, all teachers are educated and competent specialists.
Classes are held at the local Armenian church.
“My daughter is 11 years old, she understands Armenian but hardly speaks in it.
She also attends the classes and is already given homework.
We learned the word rooster and she was amazed at this word.
On the eve of the opening of the class, we prepared and arranged everything.
We wrote "Welcome".
I felt like I was in the first grade when I was still in Armenia” - she said.
Christine Movsisyan is sure that the preservation of the Armenian language in the diaspora begins with school and parenting.
Children should know and love the Armenian language, Armenian holidays and traditions.

It is not an end in itself to blame someone.
We will study all the shortcomings and gaps, and we will present appropriate decisions accordingly.
The final conclusion is not formed" said Artak Davtyan.

The founder of “Aznavour” Foundation Nicola Aznavour and the CEO Christina Aznavour attended as well.

“The committee has held numerous meetings and now, being informed about the details of the situation in Armenia, can already spread relevant information through its network among its partners in France”,- said the Deputy Chairman of the “Aznavour” Foundation Karine Evoyan in an interview with “Hayern Aysor”.
In the near future, the committee will continue coordinating the aid sent from France to Armenia to support evacuated and returning to Artsakh families and to restore infrastructure in Artsakh.
“We closely cooperate with a number of international organizations.

A contract soldier appeared in the area under the control of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces due to the fog: Ministry of Defense
RA Ministry of Defense informs that on June 8, a contract soldier of the N Military unit of the RA Armed Forces, soldier A. Katanyan, was disoriented due to the fog and appeared in the area under the control of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces.

A criminal case has been aroused concerning the incident in SyunikRA Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan held a consultation in Syunik regional administration.
He referred to the incident that took place during his visit.
“There was a violation of the law, I expect the law enforcement bodies to respond clearly and harshly.
We must not allow an atmosphere of impunity in Armenia,” said the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister stated that after the 44-day war, there is a change in the security situation around the Syunik region, which is aggravated by provocative, irregular and contradictory statements of the Azerbaijani leadership.
“On one hand, the Azerbaijani leadership states that it has no territorial claims or expectations towards Armenia, on the other hand, it announces the opening of the Zangezur corridor by force.
Today, the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry had to deny the Azerbaijani leader, saying that there is no question of encroachments on the territory of Armenia.
Nevertheless, my assessment is that these statements are provocative, they should be given due attention and response, including by our country’s diplomatic missions in the international arena,” said the Prime Minister.
Nikol Pashinyan emphasized that there are no expressions “Zangezur”, “Syunik’ or “corridor” in the November-9 statement.
It is about regional communications, which were interpreted and recorded in the January-11 Moscow statement.
If Azerbaijan talks about the Zangezur corridor, then by the same logic Armenia can talk about the Nakhichevan corridor, the North-Azerbaijani corridor, because according to the documents published in the agreement, Azerbaijan can get only such a “corridor” in case Armenia gets per contra, through the territory of Azerbaijan, including the territory of Nakhichevan,” said the Prime Minister.
Touching upon the discussions over the Syunik border, the Prime Minister said that the security of the RA borders should be increased.
The large-scale program of Armed Forces reforms has already started in Armenia, which is being implemented with the Russian Federation.
“During the implementation of that program and the reforms, we must take into account all the realities that we faced during the 44-day war.
Yes, we must become stronger, we must have an army that will be a worthy ally, the main guarantor of the security and the territorial integrity of the Republic of Armenia.
No one can stop Armenia on its way to achieve that,” the Prime Minister added.
The socio-economic issues of Syunik are at the center of the government’s attention.
A working group dealing with Syunik issues has been set up.
For the first time since the independence, a housing program is being implemented in Shurnukh community of Syunik.
A criminal case has been initiated against the father of the Khachaturyan sisters
The Investigative Committee initiated a criminal case against Mikhail Khachaturyan.
This was reported anonymously to RIA “Novosti” by one of the lawyers participating in the process.
According to the lawyer, a criminal case was initiated against Khachaturian under the articles "Violent Sexual Actions", "Compulsion to Perform Sexual Actions" and "Torture".
However, the lawyers of the injured party and the Khachaturian sisters assured “Gazeta.Ru” that they had not received an  official decision to initiate a criminal case.
However, lawyer Aleksey Liptser noted that in this case the Khachaturian sisters would become victims of violence themselves.
“We expect that during the investigation it will be proved once again that Mikhail Khachaturyan committed these crimes” - he said.
Maksim Kalinov, an independent criminal defense lawyer, believes that if Mikhail Khachaturyan is convicted posthumously, his daughters can count on a lighter sentence.
According to him, the article which the girls are charged with provides from 8 to 20 years in prison or life imprisonment.
"This can have a significant impact on their case, if the sexual violence by Mikhail Khachaturyan is proven.
An additional clause of mitigating circumstances will be applied to them - the immoral behavior of the victim” - the lawyer said.
Taking into account these circumstances, according to Article 62 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, the court can appoint two-thirds of the maximum sentence - 14 years.
If the fact of the immoral behavior of the victim is proved as well, then they can get eight years.
It should be recalled that the crime took place on the evening of July 27, 2018.
The body of 57-year-old Mikhail Khachaturyan was found with multiple stab and cut wounds in the neck and chest at the entrance of a residential building in the north of Moscow.
His three daughters were detained as prime suspects.
The girls' lawyers claim that they acted in self-defense.
At the time of the crime, the sisters were 19, 18 and 17 years old.
Subsequently, they confessed to the murder during interrogations explaining their actions by “hostile relations” with their father who had caused them “moral suffering” for a long time.

A museum inside the restaurant. Taste combines Constantinople cuisine and Ara Guler’s works under one roof. He came to his homeland to bring the tale of Constantinople to Yerevan, settled here, and decided to combine the dishes of Constantinople and the photos of Ara Guler under one roof.
Thus, Dayk Mirijanyan opened the “Jashag (Taste)” restaurant in the center of Yerevan.
It is the Armenian cuisine, the cuisine of Constantinople, in its own style, and I wanted to bring the “Jash (Lunch)” to Armenia.
Ara and I came to Armenia in 2013, he had his exhibition, we wanted to open a small museum here.
The “Jash (Lunch)” and Ara Guler “AG” joined and turned into “Jashag (Taste)”.
At the same time, the “ag” is the water source, and the eye, and Guler is the “eye of Constantinople”.
Dayk got acquainted with the world-famous Constantinople-Armenian photographer-journalist, Ara Guler, at the Mekhitarist School in Constantinople.
They became good friends and decided to create their own business in the homeland.
According to Dayk, the important thing in life is for each nation to have its own handwriting, for generations to speak and recognize the Armenians through their work.
I wanted to make it like a house of culture, Constantinople has its own style of table and dishes, it is closer to the styles of the western Mediterranean: Fish, meat, and there are more dishes with olive oil.
Ara Guler was a lover of red wine, which is why the restaurant offers a wide range of Armenian wines in different corners of the restaurant, the menu includes dishes of different cuisines, from seafood to Armenian barbecue.
The Constantinople-Armenian businessman also thought about young people and set up a pub-beerhouse next to the restaurant.
I have prepared several sets, one of them is the Constantinople set, without looking for it in the menu for a long time, people can use it to understand the style of Constantinople, which is similar to the cuisine of Aleppo or Beirut with small plates, dishes with different flavors.
Every corner at “Jashag” reminds Constantinople, the Armenians, even the furniture that was in the houses of the Armenians of Constantinople is now here.
According to Dayk Mirijanyan, this seems to be a small world in the center of Yerevan.
We had the same furniture in our house, sofas, old chairs, old furniture, different items.
I have collected all of them, I wanted to revive the things in our restaurant so that we can tell about our style to both the people of Yerevan and the tourists.
The idea of bringing the tale of Constantinople to Yerevan was prompted by Dayk Mirijanyan.
He says that the city creates a unique cultural environment with its daily life, events and people.
For me, the most interesting thing in this city is the cultural life, there are many places in the lap of nature, but the culture inspires me, I am glad to be in Yerevan.
According to the businessman, “Jashag” stands out from all restaurants, as the guests here feel at home.
Dayk Mirijanyan emphasizes that living and creating in the homeland is possible for every Armenian.

This is our approach, and let no one think that it is specifically aimed at the government” - Terzian said.
According to Petros Terzyan, nine agreements which clearly state that if there is a certain amount that has not been spent, it must be returned to the fund were signed between the fund and the government of the Republic of Armenia.
According to him, this is not a new approach: this is how the fund has worked for decades.
Commenting also on the point of view according to which the state should return the entire amount to the fund, the member of the fund's Board of Trustees noted that this would be a violation of the agreement.
“This question is groundless. 
The overwhelming majority of the Board of Trustees voted for the transfer of the amount after which agreements according to which the money is transferred to the state as a donation were signed which means that the government must submit a report” - he said.
During the meeting, issues related to the support of Artsakh were discussed as well: reconstruction, assistance to citizens, restoration of agriculture, etc.
President of the Artsakh Republic Arayik Harutyunyan told about this.
According to Terzyan, the forthcoming works will be specified in the coming days.
“Numerous programs are being implemented to address the problems of servicemen, wounded during the war, families of casualties, refugees, etc.
We hope that in the near future we will have the final list of programs that we will publish in detail so that everyone knows that the money was spent for its intended purpose” - he stressed.
According to Petros Terzyan, an inappropriate noise was raised in relation with the public's confidence in the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund, he insisted that the work of the fund should not be familiarized with political issues.
According to him, the society should be aware of the importance of the fund and patiently wait for a detailed report.

The citizens marched from the Republic Square to the Yerablur military pantheon.
The funeral procession was led by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan and authorities of the legislative and executive power.
The procession was attended by the High Commissioner for Diaspora Affairs Zareh Sinanyan.
In an interview with “Hayern Aysor”, he noted that the most important message of the procession was to honor the memory of the dead servicemen: “We will always remember the sacrifice they made for our future, I hope that in the near future we will find the strength to get out of this mourning.”
Sinanyan said that the role and involvement of the diaspora was unprecedented and that Armenia needs the support of the diaspora more than ever.
He called on everyone to unite around Armenia and overcome difficulties together.
Repatriate Vazgen Brutyan also took part in the mourning procession.
He moved to Armenia from Los Angeles many years ago: "I am here because I believe that everyone should bow to both the victims and those who were at the border and returned."
In Yerablur, the procession participants laid flowers and burned incense on the graves of the dead.

About 5,000 apartments will be built in Artsakh over the next 3 years
A regular meeting with the heads of the responsible departments of the RA Government was held under the leadership of Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan and President of the Republic of Artsakh Arayik Harutyunyan.
Participants discussed the country’s agenda in the socio-economic sphere, issues of cooperation, the progress and future of the programs that are currently being implemented with the government of Artsakh.
“I would like to remind, that one of the most important points of the route map I presented on November 18 is the restoration of regular life in Artsakh.
It should be stated, that at the moment we have tangible results but the volume of the work is very large and it is important that we express our political determination and commitment to fully implement this task and talk not only about the restoration of regular life in Artsakh, but also about further development and the implementation of specific programs in this direction” - Nikol Pashinyan said.
President of Artsakh Arayik Harutyunyan noted that the results of the work done are tangible in the sense that most of the population lives in Artsakh today.
The President stressed that in terms of normal life it seems that everything necessary has been provided.
“We have up to 30.000 residents who are in the Republic of Armenia, fortunately, very few have left the territory of the Republic of Armenia.
In terms of social payments, I believe that there will be no problems for the next few months, and the Artsakh people will have no problem with products, since the welfare benefits and lump sums will temporarily satisfy.
At this stage, our main issue is housing: we have a lot of work to do in terms of construction and provision of housing, providing employment and incomes.
Damage compensation is the second important issue, many of our compatriots have suffered great losses and together we must make a decision in terms of compensation” - he said.
The President of the Republic of Artsakh Arayik  Harutyunyan also noted that at least 5.000 apartments will be built over the next 3 years according to the future plans.
Abovyan College in Marseille
Armenians have lived in France since the early Middle Ages.
Basically, there were a lot of Armenians in Paris, Marseilles, Versailles, Lyon, Nice, Poitiers, La Rochelle, Bordeaux, Saint-Chamond, Vienne, Valence.
Since the formation of the Armenian community in France, many college-schools, public, charitable and cultural organizations have been established. During the time, these organizations have turned into unique centers for the preservation of Armenian identity.
One of them is the school named after Abovyan in Marseille.
The Khachatur Abovyan Association, also known as the Abovyan College, was founded in 1989 by a group of volunteers who brought the two already existing schools together: the AGBU school in Marseille and the school of Armenian Church of Holy Translators.
The goal of the volunteers is the following: to perpetuate the Armenian identity and culture in all its manifestations.
The college staff organizes and promotes various events: artistic, cultural, educational, as well as leisure.
The college considers it important to improve the quality of education for both adults and children.
Being fluent in French is essential to fully integrate into French society, which is why a team of volunteers teaches French there.
The college teaches reading, poetry, Armenian folk songs and dances, chess, piano, choral singing, drawing.
The priest of the Armenian Apostolic Church teaches the basics of religious education.
Khachatur Abovyan College is an apostolic college, the aim of which is to teach "knowledge" and "faith".
Khachatur Abovyan College is located in the very center of Marseille.
AGBU congratulates Pashinyan on new government formation
The Armenian General Benevolent Union congratulated Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on the formation of the new government. “AGBU congratulates Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and his team on this week’s formation of a new government of Armenia.
This, alone, is a positive achievement, given the complexities of the country’s internal political environment and the serious geopolitical challenges in the region.
The global Armenian community, along with friends of Armenia around the world, recognize our homeland’s gradual return to normalcy, using the electoral process to continue our recovery from a devastating war and political turmoil, and the ongoing struggle to bring hundreds of prisoners of war safely home.
Even as the people of Armenia have spoken for stability and peace, the new government of Armenia continues to face formidable post-conflict threats to national security, as the geopolitical realities of the South Caucasus.
We hope these tenuous conditions will prompt the Prime Minister and his new government to leverage their popular mandate by taking bold action to attract the best, brightest and most experienced talent—locally and globally— to help lead the nation forward.
The very sovereignty and security of Armenia and Artsakh will likely depend on the short-term decisions and long-term commitments made in the coming critical months and years.
By encouraging inclusive participation and mobilizing our global community, including civil society, non-profit and religious institutions, the momentum for positive change will be reinforced and sustained.
To that end, we look forward to clearer and more direct channels of communication, cooperation, and coordination between Armenia and the Diaspora, thereby facilitating Armenians residing outside the homeland the chance to serve in key government and cabinet positions, subject to parliamentary approval.
Also important to consider is a one-year mandatory in-country residency for a naturalized citizen to run for public office.
The reality we are all challenged to confront is that Armenia is facing a looming demographic catastrophe.
The 44 Day War and increased migratory pressures that marked a new low point in Armenia’s demography sets the stage for more comprehensive approaches to ensuring Armenia’s viability.
Especially now, the highest democratic standards and protection of individual freedoms can help ensure an equitable judicial system, promote transparent and responsible economic policies, and protect the right of private property.
At the same time, a better regulatory framework to limit national security threats stemming from Armenia’s current economic system could include more stringent limitations on land ownership by noncitizens.
We also hope that Armenia will continue to serve as the custodian and guardian of its civilization and society and will continue to cultivate and protect the pillars of our identity, including culture, language, education and the Church.
AGBU stands ready to wholeheartedly contribute to achieving these objectives.
We will continue our mission to help rebuild a more secure and prosperous future.
We remain committed to mobilizing our global constituency and resources to strengthen the potentials that lie within every member of the Armenian nation, from government and industry to society, community, family and youth,” the organization said in a statement.
AGBU will take over the property needs of 40 families of the Shushi district
The administration of Shushi developed and provided the AGBU with a package of property needs of families of the Shushi district.
AGBU continues its programs of assistance to Artsakh and the Armenians of Artsakh.
As a result of the discussion, the AGBU undertook to meet part of the property needs of 40 large families of Shushi district by providing families with a package of kitchen appliances and accessories that these families need.
Aghababyan School in Astrakhan
Armenians have been living in the city of Astrakhan since the time of Tatar rule in Russia.
Since the 17th century, local Armenians were especially known as traders, which made Astrakhan an important center for Armenian-Russian trade relations.
Already in the 18th century, the Astrakhan Armenians were the third in terms of population after the Russians and Tatars.
The Armenian National Court was founded here, Armenian churches and schools were built.
Representatives of the Armenian intelligentsia were concentrated in the city which played an important role in spreading scientific and educational ideas throughout the country.
One of the most important schools in Astrakhan is the Aghababyan school which was founded in 1810 with the help of the local Armenian merchant Nikoghayos Aghababyan and brothers.
The merchant built a wooden house for the school with special rooms for teachers next to the Armenian church Poghos-Petros.
He also built a stone house in the courtyard of the school for 12 children who studied at the boarding school.
Having founded the first Armenian secular school in Russia, he strove to create an educational institution that would give life-giving knowledge and skills to students, and would train good specialists in the field of navigation.
Already at the beginning of the 20th century, the school was transformed into a gymnasium, then again became an ordinary school.
Over the years, 50-150 students studied there, most of whom were Armenians.
During its existence, the school was in different buildings, houses of merchants and benefactors.
Information about school closures varies.
Some sources say that it was closed in 1922, others - in the 1940-50’s.
The school building now houses the 14th secondary school of Astrakhan.

On May 13, the Azerbaijani Armed Forces, again with the justification of “border adjustment”, carried out another provocation against the sovereign territory of the Republic of Armenia, trying to ensure positional advance in the border areas of Vardenis and Sisian.

Answer of the Spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry of Armenia to the question of the media regarding the statement of the President of Azerbaijan
Question: In an interview to one of the Azerbaijani TV channels, the President of Azerbaijan resorted to the threats of use of force against Armenia. How would you comment on that?
Answer: We strongly condemn the aspirations of the President of Azerbaijan against the territorial integrity of Armenia and the threats to use force.
Such statements seriously undermine the regional peace and stability.
They reveal the false nature of Azerbaijan's recent statements on peace and reconciliation.
It is noteworthy that such threats are made on the eve of the commemoration of the Armenian Genocide; they are intended to speak to the Armenian people from a position of force.
We are in constant touch with our strategic ally, as well as with all our partners interested in peace in the South Caucasus.
Armenia will undertake all necessary measures to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Although the walls of the building are still stable, we are not sure how long they will last, and the interior is nearly unusable». Roxanna Makasjian, Representative of the Armenian Community of San Francisco
The building was built in the 1900s and housed the church office and the Sunday school.
There were kept rare books, documents of the Armenian National Committee which were completely destroyed.
«Those who committed this crime knew very well who they were attacking, and the next day an educational institution was attacked with the use of gun.
These attacks are becoming more and more dangerous». Roxanna Makasjian, Representative of the Armenian Community of San Francisco
To prevent such cases, to punish those responsible, representatives of the Armenian National Committee launched an information campaign, contacted the police, authorities and the press.

Arman Arakelyan who was convicted for the murder of an Azerbaijani in Russia was extradited to Armenia to serve the remaining term, Arman Arakelyan’s lawyer Artur Dashyan told “FactInfo". The lawyer said they had been fighting for four years for Arman Arakelyan’s extradition to Armenia to serve the remaining term but for some reasons the process was being delayed.
Currently, the Armenian prisoner is in a pre-trial detention center after which he will be transferred to the "Armavir" penal colony.
He was serving his sentence in the Murmansk penal colony in Russia.
According to the lawyer, the issue of the threat to the prisoner's life has always been relevant because of the huge Azerbaijani influence in Russia.

Armenia and Lebanon have a joint judicial convention.
This means that the decisions of the courts of the two countries are acceptable or applicable to each other.
The author is Lebanese-Armenian lawyer Puzant Bastajian.
That is, if someone in Armenia has won a lawsuit, they can use it in Lebanon under the law of reciprocity.
Puzant Bastajian has been working on this convention for a long time.
First, coming to Armenia, he got acquainted with the laws and then decided to put forward such an idea.
The main goal was that there was no Lebanon-Armenia judicial convention
The idea arose why our homeland, Armenia and Lebanon, do not have a joint judicial convention.
We must remember that there are conventions between Armenia and Lebanon - trade, terrorism.
So why not a judicial convention?
The Lebanese-Armenian lawyer felt the need to create a judicial convention between Armenia and Lebanon while studying individual court cases.
Then he got the opportunity to work here with a license issued by the Chamber of Advocates.
A lawyer who does not have an order from the Chamber of Advocates to work here, can not just appear in court, it will not be valid.
This was the first time in history when the committee of the presidents of the Chamber of Advocates unanimously decided that I, personally, Puzant Bastajian, have the right to be present at the trial.
Puzant Bastajian is also a member of the Chamber of Advocates in Armenia.
According to him, this is the first time that a Diasporan-Armenian lawyer has such an opportunity.
This means that he can practice law in the homeland.

Armenia plans to buy hundreds of thousands of doses of “Sputnik V” vaccines/ Arsen Torosyan
Chief of the Armenian Prime Minister’s Staff Arsen Torosyan assured that no lockdown is expected in Armenia.
Therefore, election campaigns and elections will be held.
He emphasized that the formation of power by the people is a component of normal life, and that right must be protected.
Arsen Torosyan believes in the effectiveness of the Sputnik V vaccine, since he was vaccinated and did not get infected after that.
“I am the first person who was vaccinated against the coronavirus in November and December in Armenia.
After that my family members got infected, but I didn’t,” he said.
According to Torosyan, the purchase of vaccines is a priority for Armenians, no matter how it will hit the budget.
“We recently purchased  24,000 “AstraZeneca”, 15,000 “Sputnik V”.
We buy one dose of the latter for 11 dollars.
The most affordable is the Sputnik V vaccine and it is planned to buy hundreds of thousands of doses.
However, even if all of Armenia is vaccinated, the coronavirus will not disappear in the country: firstly, the vaccines are not produced for children, and secondly, there are constant visitors from other countries,” he said.
On March 31, as of 11:00, 1148 new cases of coronavirus disease were discovered in Armenia, 459 people recovered, 18 died.
Thus, the total number of tests reached 853829.

Armenian company Krisp develops noise reduction technologyFrom America to Armenia in order to found a tech company and develop the homeland.
Krisp co-founder and CEO David Baghdasaryan decided to return with his family and settle in Armenia 3 years ago.
՛՛I was born in Yerevan and worked here for 25 years, then I got a job offer from America and went for it; I lived there for about 9 years with my family, my first child was born there.
I worked in Silicon Valley.
My wife and I worked in technology sphere, so we had a pretty good career and a financially secure life there՛՛,- he said.
It was a tough decision because they were going to leave a successful career and big finances in America; but they realized that for complete happiness they wanted to be surrounded by Armenians and Armenian culture.
‘’I knew that I needed to leave the company I worked for, and in that case a lot of money would be lost.
The money was big, but the desire to return was even bigger, so, one might say, we were suffocating there.
And in fact, it was one of our best decisions’’,- said David Baghdasaryan.
David had different goals but fate arranged his meeting with his future partner, and together they decided to found the Krisp company which is very popular in Armenia and abroad.
The company has a scientific research laboratory that claims to become a world center.
‘’The idea behind Krisp was to create technology that eliminates noise during phone calls using machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies.
And although we knew a little about that sphere, we were able to create it and gained recognition throughout the world. And I urge everyone not to sit and just wait, nothing happens just like that, we have to start doing something ourselves, and then you are proud of what you did. There is no better feeling’’,-said the company CEO.
David Baghdasaryan is sure that one must live where they can think of not only about a good life, but also about big ideas and their implementation.
Krisp was founded as a result of such a big idea and continues to conquer new international markets presenting the technological potential of Armenia to the world.

Reliable information about the presence of Armenians in Italy was transmitted from the 6th-7th centuries.
From the middle of the 12th century, relatively stable Armenian communities were formed in various cities of Italy, and Armenian churches were created.
The Italian Armenians participated in many spheres of activity and showed themselves as good sailors and shipbuilders.
In 1512, it was in Venice that Hakob Meghapart published the first book in Armenian.
Armenian books were also published in Rome, Livorno, Pavia and Padova.
In 1717, the Mkhitarist Congregation was founded on the island of Saint Lazarus in Venice, and in 1836, on the initiative of the Congregation, one of the most important scientific and educational institutions was founded - the Murad-Rapaelyan boarding school. It has a long history.
In the first years after its foundation, the school worked according to the gymnasium program and provided a 6-year study course, but in 1867 it received the right to lyceum activity.
In 1917 the school was transferred to Rome, and in 1918 again to Venice.
During World War II, the school was closed and it was reopened in 1950.
In the 80’s about 120 students studied there.
The school had a rich library, museums, sports grounds, the “Sayat-Nova” orchestra and a theater group.
The school provided education in accordance with highest academic standards, with the best graduates being eligible to enter European universities without exams.
Such famous people as Ghevond Alishyan, S. Teodoryan, M․ Nurikhan, V. Avgeryan, A. Gaskantilian and others taught there and such famous people as Daniel Varuzhan, Mkrtich Peshiktashyan, Tovmas Terzyan, Vahram Papazyan, Hakob Papazyan, Edgar Shahin, Edgar Manas, Srapion Hekimyan and others studied there.
The school doors were also open to Europeans.
Famous Armenologists  Heinrich Hübschmann, Felix Neuve, Marie Felicite Brosse, Nicola Iorga , Frederic Feydi also studied there.
According to some reports, the school was closed in 1997 due to a small number of students and financial difficulties.
Later, the building was used as a venue for educational and cultural events, as well as a guest house for special guests.

The Armenian community in Moscow celebrates the Resurrection of Jesus receiving a blessing in the church.
Then people make eggs, traditionally dyed red, and sit around the dinner table with Easter wine on it.
“I do not know if you imagine our magnificent temple and its greatness, how the church and the churchyard are just full.
It takes time even for believers to enter the church, to talk to the saints, to raise their prayers.
Queues are formed because quite a lot of Armenians live here, both in Moscow and in the cities near Moscow”, - told Kerovbe fr. Barseghyan, servant of the Holy Transfiguration cathedral in Moscow.
Easter is celebrated in the same way in Chicago.
Although many do not attend church due to the pandemic, still Armenian churches broadcast the message of the day live.
“Easter is the reminder of the reality that Christ lives in us and Christ appears to us. And Christ does not just appear to us from the tomb, but he also gives us the resurrection with his second coming, the remission of sins, when we come and participate in the life of the church and receive the sacrament in the house of God”, - said Andreas fr. Karapetyan, Pastor of St. Gregory the Illuminator armenian church in Chicago.
In Germany, a limited number of people can participate in church ceremonies due to the pandemic.
The President of the Armenian Diocese of Germany remembers the participation of the Armenian community of the previous years - more than 400 people would come and take part in Easter.
Now everything has changed, people-church communication is organized through the internet.
Serovbe Odabashyan says that only the ritual of cooking traditional dishes has not changed.
“I can also tell you about my own family as an example.
I must say that it is even a little "stressful"; we make eggs, sweets.
There are also some differences here compared with Armenia, for instance, we have a special type of bread that Armenians make in Constantinople, it is called Choreg (Choereg)” , -told Serovbe Otapashyan, the president of the armenian prelacy of  Germany.
In Jerusalem, Easter will be celebrated according to the old calendar, on May 2.
On this occasion, the Armenian community of Jerusalem organizes a drum march and participates in church ceremonies.
“There is more of a union celebration here than a family one, that is, everyone may cook at home, for example, grandparents invite their children, but the main emphasis is still more on a union celebration. For example, the Armenian General Gymnastic Union (Homenetmen) sets a table, invites their members and clergymen”, - told Tiran archimandrite Hakobyan, member of the covenant of St. Hakobyants congregation of the armenian patriarchate of Jerusalem.
The Resurrection of the Lord is symbolized by the Enlightenment ceremony, which is celebrated with great pomp by the Armenians of Jerusalem.
On that day, the door of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is entrusted to the Armenians.
“Clergymen, heirs and translators of the gymnasium lead the people. The Armenian translator leads to the temple with the key of the Holy Resurrection Cathedral, where the solemn opening ceremony takes place”, - said he.
The Armenian priest gives a lit candle to the believers, which is blessed by the Armenian Patriarch.
At the end, everyone greets each other: “Christ is risen from the dead!” “Blessed is the resurrection of Christ!” (Happy Easter!)

Armenians of the Pontic littoral. Interesting story with historical facts
This is the Pontic littoral.
In the 18th century, Russia and the Ottoman Empire waged war here in order to seize strategically important territories and resources.
These clashes influenced the fate of many peoples of the Pontic littoral, including the Armenians.
How did Armenians move here over the years and how did they preserve their identity? The encyclopedia “Armenians of the Pontic littoral” tells about this.
“I communicated with many interesting people - historians, ethnographers, Armenologists, Caucasologists, collected materials for an article in the “Khachkar” newspaper.
Many of these materials which tell about the Armenian community living in the south of Russia turned out to be quite interesting.
And the idea to create a large project “The Armenians of the Pontic littoral” was born then.
Currently, about 1 million Armenians live in this region.
About 1000 articles in the encyclopedia tell about the life of different people, as well as about Armenian settlements, temples, schools and other structures.
A large group of scientists, historians and journalists worked on the book.
“Each reader of this encyclopedia can find interesting information for himself: someone, perhaps, will find a familiar surname, another - a generation that will be directly related to him.
In the articles, one can find a lot of materials that can be used in scientific works" - the author of the project said.
The book is also available online.
According to Christophor Mkhitaryan, the possibility of translation of the book into Armenian and English is being discussed.
At the moment they are working on the creation of the second volume of the encyclopedia.
It will be presented to the reader this year.

To support the Motherland, the musician left for Belgium and gave 3 concerts, all the proceeds from which he donated to the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund.
The next stop was Artsakh.
“The territory of the church was empty, there was no one there.
At any moment, the church could be struck again.
I went inside, sat down, there was just me and my friend who was filming.
As soon as I sat down, I immediately realized that I should perform "Krunk".
Seeing a broken and headless statue of an angel, a torn painting, Komitas “spoke” inside me” - said Sevak Avanesyan.
In his opinion, it was Komitas's "Krunk" that could express all the emotions that the Armenians experienced at that moment.
“Crane, where did you come from? How is our country? Because this is our land, our home; but all of us, including the residents of Yerevan and especially the Armenians of the Diaspora live outside Artsakh.
The music was very close to my heart and it was, to some extent, the voice of the crane” - said Sevak Avanesyan.
Sevak told that the floor was quaking, there was shelling during the ceasefire but in an instant almost everything went quiet when he started playing.
“We, musicians, don't really know how to speak beautifully and the only way to speak and show our emotions is through music.
Let's consider my performance to be a kind of prayer; this was my prayer to God, this was my message to the Armenian people, to the whole world and, finally, to myself.
I will stay the last one standing in this church but will not give it to anyone” - said Sevak Avanesyan.
According to Sevak, music is their way of communicating with God.
After the end of the war, the musician will again visit the Shushi church with his cello.

The Initiative to focus on supporting sustainable social development projects in the region
The Aurora Humanitarian Initiative has announced a fundamental upgrade of its Artsakh Aid program, which from now on will be focused on assisting projects that support and facilitate the region’s long-term social development.
The program, launched by Aurora in the aftermath of the war, had earlier been providing urgent humanitarian aid to the people of Artsakh on the basis of the #AraratChallenge crowdfunding initiative.
In addition, the Aurora Co-Founders Noubar Afeyan, Vartan Gregorian and Ruben Vardanyan have donated on behalf of Aurora $1 million to Hayastan All Armenian Fund for Artsakh aid programs.
This new stage will be characterized by a shift towards sustainability, intended to ensure long-term impact, and will include funding projects that support micro and small enterprises, restore infrastructure, and boost economy.
In the meantime, the Initiative remains committed to preserving and promoting Armenian legacy in the region and will also keep on assisting projects that provide direct aid to the underserved communities in Artsakh.
“Following the ceasefire established between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Aurora played an important role in providing immediate relief to the Armenians of Artsakh facing a grave humanitarian crisis.
Today, strategic solutions are needed on the ground, and we are very excited to be one of the first to bring long-term social development back to the agenda and to support the projects that fuel it,” said Narine Aghabalyan, Head of Aurora’s Artsakh program.
Having already acted as one of the key humanitarian leaders of the region, Aurora plans to bring the Initiative’s partners together to share best practices at a conference that will be organized in April, as well as to engage experts from the Armenian Diaspora and to contribute to the development of a humanitarian platform designed to connect all stakeholders under the auspices of the Aurora Humanitarian Initiative.
Since the launch of its humanitarian aid program for Artsakh, the Aurora Humanitarian Initiative has already allocated a total of $581,740 (300,660,500֏) to support fifty-seven local and international projects listed below. auroraprize.com
Azerbaijan does not fulfill its obligations. Nikol Pashinyan
During the government session, Acting Prime Minister, Nikol Pashinyan, said that Azerbaijan was not fulfilling its obligations regarding the return of Armenian captives and other detainees.
He stated that this fact has already become an issue on the international agenda.
“Yesterday, the European Union issued a statement very late in the evening, in which it recorded a very specific, very targeted statement that Azerbaijan should return all the captives, regardless of the specific circumstances of their captivity.
This is a very important statement, and I consider it important that this statement refers to the processes taking place in the ECHR, which, in fact, adds a legal component to the political statement,” Pashinyan said.
Nikol Pashinyan also noted that the recent international activity on the issue of the captives increases the optimism that there will be concrete results in this issue.
The members of the government also discussed the epidemic situation in the country, emphasizing the importance of the vaccination process against coronavirus.
“We now, thank God, have a great potential for vaccination, but we face a problem that this potential is not realized in the right amount and scale, which causes certain risks,” said the Acting Prime Minister.
What opportunities do citizens have to be vaccinated? How to use them? The details were presented by the Acting Minister of Health Anahit Avanesyan.
“Dear citizens, regardless of the place you are attached to, you can register at your preferred polyclinic and get the vaccine.
From next week we will have mobile teams, which will be located in busy parts of the city and bring one step closer to the possibility of vaccinating our citizens.
I was vaccinated yesterday, and Mr. Avinyan, as well. I feel very well, I hope this example will be contagious,” said the Acting Prime Minister.
Armenia will soon import a vaccine from China, as well.
Nikol Pashinyan emphasized that if any vaccine poses a threat to the lives of citizens, the government will not accept it.
I think it is very important that all the voices that start a campaign against vaccines be silenced.
Mr. Kerobyan, the business must also be involved, so that this process can be carried out at a proper level. Mr. Harutyunyan, I think that the vaccination process should be carried out in the Armed Forces as well, in state bodies in general, we must assume that leadership.” said the Acting Prime Minister.
Cannabis production will be allowed in Armenia.
Import, export and wholesale trade will be allowed under the relevant license.
It will be forbidden to use it as a drug.
“A rather serious control system is envisaged to prevent the production of industrial cannabis, as well as its export, import and wholesale trade in the field of opium.
And that control will be carried out by the inspection bodies, in particular, the involvement of the police in the process is supposed,” said the Acting Deputy Prime Minister Tigran Avinyan.
According to Tigran Avinyan, high state duty rates are envisaged for this activity, taking into account the amount of profitability.
According to the draft regulations, production will be allowed only in closed areas.
“Azerbaijan has said no to everything.” Nikol Pashinyan on the Nagorno-Karabakh negotiations 
RA National Assembly convened a special session, during which the leader of the “My Step” faction, Lilit Makunts, presented Nikol Pashinyan’s candidacy for the position of Prime Minister.
In his speech, Nikol Pashinyan emphasized the consensus on holding elections, which was reached with the NA factions and the RA President.
“During this period, there are many discussions and speculations that at some point, some forces will try to develop a different scenario in the second stage.
I said last time from this pulpit that if there are attempts to violate the agreements, we have a ready solution, in which case the “My Step” faction will elect a prime minister.
And I hope that no attempts will be made to violate the agreements in any way,” Pashinyan said.
Nikol Pashinyan referred to the issue of the coronavirus epidemic, called on everyone to be vaccinated, to cover the process of vaccination.
He stressed that travel restrictions will be in place soon and vaccination will be mandatory for tourists.
Pashinyan called not to speculate on the vaccine.
In response to the question of the NA deputy Tigran Urikhanyan, Nikol Pashinyan spoke about the interview of the third RA President Serzh Sargsyan, where he spoke about the Nagorno-Karabakh issue and the negotiation process, by which he emphasized that after 2018 the negotiations were disrupted.
Pashinyan noted that such statements are a good opportunity to open new layers of negotiation content, for which there were certain restrictions before.
“The content of the negotiations changed in autumn 2015-winter 2016.
If Serzh Sargsyan has decided to make revelations, let him tell people about the events of autumn 2015-winter 2016, after which came the spring of 2016, April 2, the content of the negotiations changed at that time. There are protocols that I have worked with after becoming Prime Minister in 2018,” he said.
Within the framework of the same question, Nikol Pashinyan also spoke about the issue of handing over the regions at 5+2’s, saying that Azerbaijan did not agree to that, as well.
“The Armenian side said that we are handing over the 7 regions, Azerbaijan said no. The Armenian side said that we accept that the entire population of Nagorno-Karabakh, including Azerbaijanis, should take part in clarifying the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan has said no, again.
Azerbaijan has said no to everything.
By the way, during the war, I gave several interviews and said that anything that Armenia agrees with, even the worst-case scenario, the next moment Azerbaijan does not agree, it wants more,” Pashinyan added.
He reminded that in April 2018, Serzh Sargsyan announced from the pulpit of the National Assembly about the failure of the negotiation process, the start of the logic of war, the videos of which are available.
Azerbaijan lies that the captured Armenian servicemen were in their area
The Ministry of Defense informed that the statement spread by the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Azerbaijan, according to which the Armenian servicemen captured by the Azerbaijani Armed Forces were in the area of Azerbaijan, does not correspond to reality.
The Ministry of Defense has published a detailed map of the place.
It should be reminded that in the early morning of May 27, in the border part of Gegharkunik region of the Republic of Armenia, during the engineering works in the area of the N military unit of the RA Armed Forces, six servicemen of the RA Armed Forces were surrounded and captured by the servicemen of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces.

“Azerbaijan violates international law by illegally invading the territory of the Republic of Armenia.” Tankian
The soloist of the “System of a Down” musical band, rock musician Serj Tankian, has called the world’s attention to the war crimes committed by dictatorial Azerbaijan on his Twitter page.
“It is unacceptable that organizations and companies continue to deal with a dictatorship like Azerbaijan, which commits war crimes, violates international law by detaining Armenian prisoners of war and illegally invading the territory of Armenia.
It is unacceptable,” Serj Tankian wrote.
Azeris have obviously falsified maps: Nikol PashinyanThe situation is the same in Syunik.
The Azeri soldiers have not yet left the “Sev Lich (Black Lake)” area.
During the government session, Nikol Pashinyan said that what happened in the part of the lake was a pre-planned provocation.
“There are Azerbaijani soldiers near the lake, a large number of our soldiers are there, but I want to say that the situation has not developed into a military escalation, that is, there are no clashes, because work has been underway to evacuate Azerbaijani soldiers from this area since yesterday.” - Pashinyan said.
Nikol Pashinyan said that the Azerbaijanis have obviously falsified maps, with which they want to substantiate that they are inside the borders of Azerbaijan.
According to Pashinyan, how it was possible for the Azeris to cross the border and reach the lake through intermediate sections is a separate issue, which will definitely be considered.
“We must take this situation very seriously, because, in fact, we are dealing with a crisis, which may have several scenarios for further development.
The Azerbaijani armed forces must withdraw to the starting positions, that is, the positions from which they started advancing, the positions where they were as of May 10,” he said.
The Acting Prime Minister also stressed that the Ministry of Defense and the National Security Service did not deny what happened and then confirmed it, they rather denied the circulating misinformation about the hostilities, the wounded, the victims, after which the situation was assessed and complete information was given.
Nikol Pashinyan said that now work is underway in the lake area, after the government session there will be a Security Council session, the developments will be discussed.

By virtue of the law, Onik Gasparyan is considered dismissed of his post as Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. Prime Minister's Office
The office of the RA Prime Minister made a statement that Onik Gasparyan is considered dismissed of his post as Chief of the General Staff of the RA Armed Forces by virtue of the law.
“Guided by the RA Constitution and the relevant provisions of the RA Law on Military Service and the Status of Military Personnel, on February 25, 2021, the Prime Minister sent a draft decree to the President of the Republic with a proposal to dismiss the Chief of the General Staff of the RA Armed Forces Onik Gasparyan.
On February 27, 2021, the draft decree was sent back to the Prime Minister's Office with the President's objections.
The objections presented by the President were not agreed by the Prime Minister about which a letter with appropriate justifications was sent to the President of the Republic on February 28, 2021.
Considering the fact that the President did not sign the draft submitted by the Prime Minister within the time limits specified in part 3 of Article 35.1 of the RA Law on Military Service and the Status of Military Personnel and did not apply to the Constitutional Court on the basis of part 3 of Article 139 of the Constitution, as well as part 6 of Article 35.1 and part 3 of Article 40 of the RA Law on Military Service and the Status of Military Personnel, Chief of the General Staff of the RA Armed Forces Onik Gasparyan is considered dismissed of his post starting from March 10, 2010.
Shortly after this statement, the RA President's Administration announced that the President had submitted an application to the Constitutional Court with a request to determine the issue of compliance of the Law on Military Service and the Status of Military Personnel dated November 15, 2017 with the Constitution.
The submission of the application is also conditioned by the problems in the law enforcement practice of this law which became more obvious as a result of the initiative of the Prime Minister to dismiss the Chief of the General Staff of the RA Armed Forces Onik Gasparyan and subsequent constitutional legal processes.
The Constitutional Court, within the limits of its competence, has the opportunity to conduct a comprehensive and systematically interrelated consideration of this issue and make a decision.
In the context of the interpretation and application of the above mentioned law, the decisions of the Constitutional Court and possible measures taken on the submitted application can have a serious impact on the decisions taken up to this point, current and future processes related to the current situation.
The President of the Republic expresses the hope that the appropriate decision will be made as soon as possible and will contribute to the resolution of the current crisis” - the statement of the Presidential Administration said.
Canadian Armenian business consultant comes to help his homelandPatrick Elliott is returning from Canada to Armenia with a clear determination to help businesses and develop the country.
He was 11 when he first visited his homeland.
Armenia was not like Canada, the not-so-good condition of the country remained in young Patrick’s memories for long.
"Then I started coming back to Armenia more often, and each time I was more in love.
My brother also lives in Armenia," Patrick says.
Patrick is a business consultant.
Weeks ago he was again in Armenia to get acquainted with the number of businesses.
He thinks that there are wonderful business opportunities in Armenia so he will help to find customers from abroad and earn more money.
"We need to change our country to become a strong place.
That is our job. The only question we have to ask ourselves now is how we can change Armenia, and what every Armenian can do for that," he said.
He is happy to see how Armenians from different countries return to their homeland, exchange ideas, and work to make the future of the country better.
Despite that, he thinks there is still a problem of correctly presenting Armenia's opportunities in the Diaspora.
This is what prevents many people from coming and settling in the homeland.
"Diaspora Armenians should come to help.
I have a friend in Montreal. He is a smart guy; he is a blond Armenian like me.
He had a restaurant which closed due to the pandemic, and he lost a lot of money.
One day he told me he was bored in Montreal.
I advised him to go to Armenia and try to put up a business there.
“What is there to do?” he asked me.
In other words, Armenia has problems with advertising.
Many Armenians still think it is a poor country, but it is not so anymore!" Patrick says.
Patrick and his wife are now in Poland.
They decided to get married in Haghpat.
They will return to Armenia in May, without a return ticket this time.

Church of St. Sahak-Mesrop in Cologne
Armenian-German relations have a long history.
Some great Armenians like Levon Shant, Avetik Isahakyan, artists Hakob Kojoyan, Vardges Surenyants and others studied at German educational institutions where there are many centers of Armenian studies.
The influx of Armenians into Germany became especially active during the years of the Armenian Genocide and after, until the 1990’s.
The Armenians of Germany have succeeded in various spheres, working as scientists, builders, traders, etc.
Today, about 50-60 thousand Armenians live in Germany.
There are Armenian schools, media, public and charitable organizations.
The Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Germany was founded in 1991 in Cologne, the most Armenian-populated city in the country.
Under its auspices, there are 14 church communities scattered across major cities.
One of the few churches in the country is the Church of St. Sahak-Mesrop in Cologne.
In Germany, there are no church buildings built by Armenians, and the existing ones were given to the Armenian Diocese for long-term and free use.
In the building of the Church of St. Sahak-Mesrop, given to the Armenian Prelacy, there was a German Protestant church, and in January 1999 the Catholicos of All Armenians Garegin I consecrated it in honor of St. Sahak-Mesrop.
Renovating it and completing the interior decoration work later, the representatives of the German Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church tried to create the atmosphere of the Armenian Church.
"Citizens should see a new quality of order in the streets of Yerevan." Nikol Pashinyan
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan with Police Chief Vahe Ghazaryan visited the Police Patrol Service Regiment early this morning, where he was present at the line inspection.
Nikol Pashinyan congratulated on the launch of the Patrol Police Service.
"This is one of the most important reforms in our government, which fits into the logic of police reform.
"But in reality, we have to look at this in a broader context: in the logic of the rule of law, state-citizen, police-citizen relations, reforms," ​​he said.
The police presents itself with a new image, new technical equipment, new professional skills.
According to Nikol Pashinyan, the result of this should be a new quality of law in the Republic of Armenia, in this case in the capital Yerevan, because the Patrol Police service starts from the capital Yerevan.
"The people of the Republic of Armenia have given the government a mandate to establish the rule of law. The citizens of the Republic of Armenia must see the rule of law as a result of the patrol police service and see a new quality of order in the streets of Yerevan.
And this is the most important mission you have to accomplish.
But we must state that the rule of law, the dictatorship of law, is established not only by punishments, not only by sanctions, but also by guiding, supporting and helping the citizens so that they fit into the situation and act correctly in the given situation, in the logic of law.
On the other hand, the citizen should see that the law is a phenomenon that comes to their aid, supports them, and does not create obstacles for them," said prime minister.
According to Nikol Pashinyan, every citizen of the Republic of Armenia should see and record that the law, the power of the government, the power of the people, the determination, the backwardness are the basis on which our government and our system of law stand, and on which Citizens' relations with each other and the government are based.
"Civil disobedience must be stopped and a dialogue must be started." Head of the Union of Armenians of Lithuania
The head of the Union of Armenians of Lithuania Arayik Tunyan stated that the Armenian community expresses concern about the processes that violate the state unity and damage Armenia on these critical days for the state.
“The Union of Armenians of Lithuania calls on the Armenian people not to join destructive actions that undermine the foundations of the state but to join constructive processes that unite national and state institutions and creative potential.
The only reasonable and legal way to resolve the issue of the formation of state power is the formation of state institutions on the basis of the free expression of the will of the people.
I wish everyone unity and common sense” - the statement says.
Various structures of diaspora have already started joining this statement.
“We believe that the parties should sit down and come to an agreement.
Today we are in such a situation that solidarity should become our dialogue” - Arayik Tunyan said in the interview with “Hayern Aysor”.
The head of the Union of Armenians of Lithuania stressed that they agree with the statement of the RA Prime Minister on the termination of the civil disobedience and the beginning of a dialogue.
"Coffee Capital" or "City of Wonders". The atmosphere of hospitality always reigns in Colombian Armenia
One of the most beautiful cities in South America and one of the largest tourist centers in Colombia is called Armenia.
There are different versions of the origin of the name of the city.
It got its name from an estate that belonged to Armenians in 1880, but received the status of a city only nine years later.
The new settlement was named Villa Holguín, after the then President Carlos Holguín Mallarino.
Years after the Khamidi massacre, and then after the Armenian Genocide in 1915, the city was renamed Armenia in memory of the killed Armenians.
In 1972, Armenian businessmen from California founded a charitable organization in the city.
In their honor, one of the city streets was named "Movsisyan and Samuelyan".
The city of Armenia became the epicenter of a strong earthquake in Colombia in 1999.
After the catastrophe, the city was supported by various countries, but the support of the Armenians was especially great.
In those years, Colombian President Ernesto Samper expressed his gratitude on this occasion.
“We are grateful to the Armenians who helped us in those difficult times” - he said.
The Armenian aid was not just financial.
Large groups of Argentine Armenians were involved in the restoration of the city as well.
By tradition, Colombian cities have 2 names.
The second name of Armenia is "City of Wonders''.
The atmosphere of hospitality and friendship inherent in Armenians always reigns here.
Many residents of other Colombian cities prefer to spend their holidays in Armenia.
The worldwide popularity of coffee was a turning point for the Colombian economy.
The world's only coffee museum was established in Armenia.
It is no coincidence that it is also called the "Coffee Capital" of Colombia, because the rapid development of the city is due to the development of the coffee industry.
Tourists can not only watch the process of making aromatic coffee, but also take part in it.
Every year on June 27 Colombians celebrate National Coffee Day with a festival that attracts thousands of tourists from all over the world.

Criminal proceedings have been instituted against the Azerbaijanis who attacked the Armenians in Tomsk
German Ananyants, vice-president of the Union of Armenians of Russia, said that criminal proceedings under Article 2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (incitement of hatred between interethnic groups and fighting) have been instituted against the Azerbaijanis who attacked Armenians about two weeks ago in one of the bars in Tomsk.
As a result of the Azeri attack, three Armenians were hospitalized and are now at home.
“During the fight, the Azerbaijanis shouted out nationalistic, anti-Armenian words, demanding from the Armenians to leave the bar.
At the moment, one of the Azerbaijanis has been arrested and is cooperating with the investigation, the other is on the wanted list, and I am sure that he will soon be found.
All participants in the fight are citizens of Russia” - German Ananyants said.
The situation is under the control of not only the prosecutor's office, but also of the chairman of the Tomsk regional branch of the Union of Armenians of Russia who was previously a colonel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

The song "Gravity" helped Hovik Demirchyan to conquer the hearts of Armenian and Greek music lovers.
His performance at the Eurovision Song Contest brought him great recognition at the homeland, and now Hovik can also be listened to in Armenian.
Thus, he stays connected to Armenia.
Despite the fact that he was born and raised in Cyprus, and visited Armenia only twice, he considers himself an Armenian and talks about it everywhere.
“Years ago, when I took part in the Greek version of the X-Factor project, I was told that my name can cause problems: it can be difficult for people to remember it.
I said that we will not change my name under any circumstances.
People could remember Madonna’s name, and they will remember the name Hovik as well” - the Cypriot-Armenian musician recalls.
Hovik and music met on New Year's Eve.
That night they confessed their love to each other and from that day they decided to be together until the end of their lives.
“My mom keeps telling me that I was 4 years old when we went to an event with a musical orchestra on New Year's Eve.
I got out of my mother's hands and went up to the maestro and began leading the orchestra with him.
My mother says that at that moment she realized that I would become a singer” - he said.
Hovik graduated from the Conservatory in Cyprus and began writing songs.
He is now one of the most famous voices in Cyprus.
He says that he is not anxious before stepping on stage.
He sings in Greek and English.
“During concerts, I also sing in Armenian whenever the opportunity arises.
This usually happens when I can feel that the soul and mind of the audience are open to listen to a song in a new language” - Hovik said.
A week ago, they released a new song with singer Arpi, and in summer, the singer will visit Armenia.
In June, Hovik will perform on the Yerevan stage.

“We sent letters to the ambassadors of Russia, America and France, so that this situation would immediately end with their help.
The demonstrations were widely covered in the local press, it caused a massive reaction throughout Cyprus”,- Mahtesyan said.
According to Mahtesyan there were people who wanted to volunteer and fight alongside the soldiers.
“We called on all members of our community and our Greek brothers and sisters to raise funds”,- he noted.
He also noted that on Artsakh issue he contacted the President of Cyprus Nikos Anastasiades and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Nikos Christodoulidis who immediately made statements, expressed their support and condemned the war started by Azerbaijan and Turkey.
“We had telephone conversations with the Speaker of the Cypriot Parliament and Speaker of the National Assembly of Armenia Ararat Mirzoyan to keep abreast of what was happening.
I contacted Nikos Tornaritis, the Head of the Cyprus Delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, so that he expressed his support for the Armenian people via Twitter and other means”,- he said.
Mahtesyan is sure that the soldiers will win: “I am sure that the future is ours, we must win, because we are Armenians, Armenian blood flows in our veins, I have no doubt about it”.

Defense Ministry denies news of demarcations along Tavush border
The RA Ministry of Defense shared a message that the information spread in social networks and various media that about 500 Russian peacekeepers and Azerbaijanis have already been demarcating along the border in several villages of the Tavush region for two days is not true.
The Ministry of Defense urged to refrain from spreading unverified, especially false information.
This news was also denied by the administration of the Tavush region.
Hayk Chobanyan stressed that the Armenian border, as before, is fully guarded by the RA armed forces.
Hayk Chobanyan posted on his Facebook: “I consider these immoral and irresponsible statements to be a personal insult to me and the residents of Tavush, I will personally make sure that all the guilty at least publicly apologize.
We assess false and panic-causing publications as a crime and ask law enforcement agencies to take action.”
Many users spread information on social networks that in Azatamut, Kayan and Barkhudarlu communities of Tavush region, about 500 Russian peacekeepers and Azerbaijanis have been demarcating along the border for two days.
They were outraged that the media did not cover the issue.
Diaspora's reaction to the internal political situation in Armenia. It is necessary to start a dialogue
The Diaspora is closely following the latest events in Armenia.
Paikar Svazlyan, President of the Union of Armenians of Italy, told “Hayern Aysor” that they were worried about the postwar internal struggle in their homeland.
“We agree that it is necessary to start a dialogue because following democratic ideas does not mean that there should be  disorder in the country.
Therefore, everything should remain within the framework of dialogue and not lead to a fratricidal civil war.
Our people do not deserve such a misfortune” - Svazlyan said.
According to the President of the Union of Armenians of Italy, it is necessary to think about eliminating the consequences of the war, strengthening the state, avoiding actions that pose a threat to national security.
President of the Federation of Armenian Organizations of the Netherlands Mato Hakhverdyan stated that the Armenian community in the Netherlands supports the legitimate government and does not consider the post-war threats and street struggle acceptable.
“At present, it is best to start joint consultations and find solutions that will be useful for Armenia.
Unfortunately, the opposition does not offer solutions other than speeches and slogans.
It seems to me that the proposal of the Prime Minister that the political forces begin consultations is a good format, if it is accepted and the disobedience stops.
And if early elections are to be held, they must be held in peace otherwise it will be impossible.
It is unacceptable to hold rallies every day or block the streets” - Mato Hakhverdyan said.
According to Hakhverdyan, it is necessary to stop demonstrations, change the approach and support the state: “Internal stability depends on the country's security.
We must be reasonable, act  according to the Constitution, adventures have never led us to anything good, will not lead now either."
Mikael Minasyan, President of the Association of European and Armenian Specialists in Berlin, believes that urgent political solutions must be found in this situation.
According to Minasyan, in order to strengthen the state and the army, it is necessary to deliver the humanitarian cargo sent to Armenia to needy families as soon as possible.
Digitized versions of "Azdak" newspaper have been transferred to the National Library of Armenia.
Shahan Gantaharyan, editor-in-chief of the Lebanese newspaper “Azdak”, handed over to the National Library of Armenia the digitized collections of the newspaper from 1927 to the present day.
As reported by "alikonline.ir", on this occasion a memorandum was signed between the National Library of Armenia and the Lebanese newspaper "Azdak".
Head of the National Library Anna Chulyan noted that within the framework of cooperation for the 100th anniversary of Azdak in 2027, the bibliography of Azdak will appear in the National Library.
“We hope that this will become a precedent for working with the diaspora press” - Chulyan noted.
The editor-in-chief of the newspaper considered the transfer of electronic materials to Armenia an important event, since materials published in the Middle East are under threat due to the war.
“This is the most professional way of preservation” - said Shahan Gantaharyan, adding that preparing a bibliography of this huge material will be very useful for those who want to do media research and study the history of the diaspora.

Director of Hayastan All-Armenian Fund on fundraising and humanitarian aid
From the first days of the war to the present, the fund received more than 180 tons of cargo from different countries.
Haykak Arshamyan, the Executive Director of the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund, told about this to “The Netherlands Diary”.
“During the war when these goods were sent there was a procedure according to which we could refuse the cargo, and the state distributed them to three ministries: health, emergency situations and defense.
Accordingly, since these ministries worked closely with the government, they knew where and what to send.
During the war, the fund mostly gave up cargo in favor of the ministry that could handle the distribution task very quickly.
After the war, the fund registered all the goods in its own name and applied to the charity commission with a request to exempt it from taxes” - Arshamyan said.
According to Haykak Arshamyan, in the Netherlands the foundation is mainly engaged in prosthetics, and a lot of prostheses have already been purchased.
Within the framework of this program, a specialized prosthetist arrived in Armenia.
The executive director of the foundation also commented on rumors that some structures allegedly did not transfer money collected during the war to the foundation: “No structure can collect money on behalf of the Hayastan foundation and spend it instead of transferring it to the foundation.
This is a violation of ethics.
For example, now a large amount of money has been collected in the United States after the war, and this amount will be sent after a certain amount is spent in Armenia."
The Hayastan All-Armenian Fund raised about $170 million from September 27 to November 10, and after the war, fundraising continued: $23 million was raised in the United States, $3 million in France, and so on.
Haykak Arshamyan noted that during the war, from October 8 to November 1, the board of trustees of the fund transferred $107 million to the government of the Republic of Armenia after which a special treasury account was created in the Ministry of Finance where the fund transferred money.
9 transfers were carried out, 9 contracts according to which the money was to be spent only on solving humanitarian, social, infrastructural and medical issues were signed.
Arshamyan said that the Ministry of Finance regularly sends working documents showing how much money was spent in each field.
“During the war, lots of humanitarian goods worth millions of dollars were purchased for Artsakh, we sent thousands of heaters, stoves, cabinets, UAZ vehicles; we sent everything we could” - said the fund's Executive Director.
According to Haykak Arshamyan, people’s current attitude towards the RA government or the foundation may be conditioned by the outcome of the war.
He confidently noted that if people were informed during the war about the transfer of money to the government of the Republic of Armenia, they would still participate in fundraising.
Arshamyan expressed the hope that if the found publishes its 2020 annual report and people see how much work has been done, they will understand that all these rumors and slander are misplaced.

DSCC Member Elen Asatryan Introduces Resolution Urging Release of Armenian POWs; Calls for Divesting from, Condemning, and Sanctioning Turkey and Azerbaijan.
Los Angeles, CA - LACDP Elected Member and DSCC Member Elen Asatryan has introduced a resolution, which will be considered at the California Democratic Convention taking place from April 29 through May 2, condemning Turkey and Azerbaijan for the war crimes they committed over the course of 44 days after their attack on the Republic of Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh) and Armenia, which began on September 27, 2020.
The resolution also urges Congress and the Biden Administration to sanction Turkey and Azerbaijan and demand that Azerbaijani authorities immediately release all Armenian POWS and captured civilians.
Furthermore, it also calls on the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the State Teachers’ Retirement System to take socially responsible steps and divest all public employee retirement funds from investment vehicles issued by Turkey and Azerbaijan until Turkey recognizes the Armenian Genocide of 1915 - 1923, and until the people of Artsakh are afforded the opportunity of self-determination on their indigenous lands.
“Authoring this resolution is deeply personal because Armenian-Americans are among the diverse constituents I am proud to represent in my capacity as an elected member of Los Angeles County’s Democratic Party and Democratic State Central Committee.
It is our duty and our moral responsibility as an organization to take a firm stand against human rights violations, to show solidarity in this moment of pain, to amplify the voices of our minority communities against the voices of oppression, and to uphold the basic values of life, liberty, and pursuit of a dignified existence.
This is a humanitarian crisis that demands bold leadership and our immediate attention,” emphasized Asatryan.
The situation is dire, lives are at stake with Armenian POWs and civilian hostages still being held captive and continuous threats from the Dictators Erdogan and Alliev to finish their mission of annihilating the Armenian people.
Turkey and Azerbaijan must be held accountable not only for the war crimes they continue to commit to date, but for the inappropriate allocation of our American tax dollars towards these war crimes,” “If we don’t take a strong stance now, then nothing sets us apart from the international community in 1915 who stood by and watched the Armenian Genocide unfold- and did nothing to stop it.
I am hopeful that my peers and fellow leaders within the Democratic Party will reflect on the critical importance of this time-sensitive resolution and will shepherd its passage at the state convention, and thank all the elected officials, sponsors, and organizations who have helped bring the resolution to this point,” she added.
“Because genocide is not some relic of the past, it’s happening right now in places around the world.
Only months ago, Turkey and Azerbaijan made war against the Armenians in Artsakh, and many Armenians fear that another genocide could take place at any time.
Speaking this simple truth can help deter other crimes against humanity by demonstrating that those who engage in mass murder will be held accountable,” stated Congressman Adam Schiff who is a sponsor on the resolution.
“As the grandchild of four genocide survivors and as a third generation refugee of the genocide, I see the recent offensive by the Azerbaijani and Turkish governments as the continuation of the legacy of genocide, the uprooting of my indigenous Armenian community from our ancestral lands and the destruction of our cultural heritage.
This resolution is timely and essential because it calls for holding the Azerbaijani and Turkish governments accountable for their ongoing human rights violations against my people.
Our tax dollars can no longer support the war crimes of these governments,” stated LACDP Elected Member and DSCC Members Suzie Abajian who stands as a sponsor to the CDP resolution.
The original resolution was submitted with the maximum 35 DSCC sponsors allowed and includes Congressman Adam Schiff and DSCC Members Suzie Abajian, Hans Johnson, Vanuhi Vartanian, Cindy Montoya, Ellen Finkelpearl, John Harabedian, Josue Barnes, Drexel Heard, Koreen Cea, Todd Jones, Jessica Craven, Linda Perez, Malcolm Johnson, Kev Abazajian, Gina Clayton-Tarvin, Sean Abajian, Melissa Taylor, Rebecca Wolfersberger, Luis Lopez, Mia Livas Porter, Marco Flores, Tina Fredericks, Steven Fisher, Karen Suarez, Mary Ann Lutz, Kathleen Patterson, Angelica Duenas, Tim Wendler, Mindy Pfeiffer, Jacinta Lincke, Kenneth Armstrong, Jason Small, and Thom O'Shaughnessy.
Letters of support were sent to the committee members from over 125 organizations, leaders, delegates and fellow democrats urging passage of the resolution, including the Armenian National Committee of America - Western Region, Armenian Assembly of America, Southern California Armenian Democrats, Pan Armenian Council of the Western United States and its 24 regional and national Armenian-American religious, political and civil organizations, the Glendale Teachers Association, East Area Progressive Democrats, Los Angeles Councilmember Paul Krekorian, and others.
The California Democratic Party’s resolutions committee has the authority to amend language of any resolution it receives.
It also has authority to combine resolutions, should there be multiple resolutions submitted that are similar in topic, without needing prior approval from those who have authored the resolutions.
Though there were two resolutions similar in topic, and the other resolution’s  author has been added to the referenced resolution, the committee chose to use the language of Asatryan’s resolution exclusively, worked with Asatryan exclusively on amendments, and agreed to keep the language of her original resolution mainly in place.
This resolution comes on the heels of President Biden formally recognizing the Armenian Genocide as genocide and  another unanimously-passed resolution by the LA County Democratic Party in October 2020, which condemned Azerbaijan and Turkey for committing war crimes during their 2020 attacks on the Republic of Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh) and Armenia and called on the U.S. to immediately impose sanctions and halt military aid to Azerbaijan and Turkey.
California is home to over one million Armenian Americans, a large majority of whom are directly impacted by the current threats and are descendants of Armenian genocide survivors, who have been tirelessly advocating for global assistance and intervention as they witnessed the unimaginable sufferings of their family members overseas, inflicted by Turkey and Azerbaijan.
The California Democratic party is the dominant political party in the state.
Representing over 10.3 million democrats, it is also the largest democratic entity in the United States.
During the meeting with the Armenian National Committee of Great Britain, the Armenian side raised the issue of Armenian prisoners of war
On March 8, during the meeting organized by the Armenian National Committee of Great Britain, RA Human Rights Defender Arman Tatoyan made a special report.
During his speech, he touched upon the issue of the immediate return of Armenian prisoners of war.
The meeting was attended by the British Ambassador to Armenia John Gallagher, representatives of all parliamentary parties, Chairman of the parliamentary friendship group with Armenia Tim Lofton and others.
Arman Tatoyan noted that the Azerbaijani government is artificially delaying and politicizing the process, he also presented in detail those humanitarian and international human rights norms according to which the immediate release of captives and their safe return are expected.
Presenting them as "terrorists" is a flagrant violation of international law.
Arman Tatoyan also provided information on the course of the war: torture, beheadings by the Azerbaijani armed forces, etc.
Tatoyan presented his new concept according to which a demilitarized zone should be created to ensure the security of the residents of Syunik: “The situation related to the border has seriously violated and endangered the rights of the border residents of Armenia and continues causing concern with the residents of the villages” - Arman Tatoyan stressed in his report.

ECHR has notified the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on violation of Armenian POWs' rights
On March 9, the European Court of Human Rights, on the basis of numerous appeals by the representative of Armenia to the ECHR, as well as taking into account the fact that the Azerbaijani government repeatedly violated the terms of the European Court and did not provide full information, made a decision to notify the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on the violations of the Armenian POWs' rights.
This was reported on the Facebook page of the RA representative to the ECHR.
It is noted that the Court's decisions to apply an interim measure against Azerbaijan regarding the prisoners of war are still in force.
The European Court ordered the Azerbaijani side to provide information about the conditions of detention of the captives, their health, as well as the measures taken to return them.
As regards the claims for interim measures against the Republic of Armenia, the European Court also noted that given the nature of information provided by the Government of Armenia, it has decided to not apply interim measures, and therefore there is no need to notify the Committee of Ministers.

Firstly, Aznavour was baptized, then got married there. Armenian Cathedral of Surb Hovhannes Mkrtich in Paris
The Armenian-French friendship has a long history.
The first Armenians settled in France in the early Middle Ages, creating communities in Paris, Marseille, Versailles, Lyon, Nice, Bordeaux, Vienne, Valence and a number of other cities.
Forming an active Armenian community, the Armenians of France have built numerous schools, social and cultural centers that serve to preserve the Armenian identity.
Alongside with it, spiritual life was also actively developing.
The Armenian religious communities of the Armenian Apostolic Church in France are united in Paris, Lyon and Marseille.

The building was designed by the French architect Albert Desiree Gilbert.
The church is located on 8th street of Jean Goujon in Paris, next to the Champs Elysees.

Our main goal is to make sure that our voice is heard precisely in the government and European structures”,- said the Secretary of the Union of Armenians in Bulgaria, Spiritual Shepherd Nerses Ketikyan in an interview with “Hayern Aysor”.
The protest continued on Andranik Ozanyan Square in Varna.
Demonstrators read out a statement on behalf of the Armenian community which calls on the European Commission and the European Parliament to clearly condemn the actions of Azerbaijan and especially Turkey, as well as the presence of terrorist groups. At the same time, the issue of recognition of the Republic of Artsakh should be raised; the recognition of their right to self-determination should be officially accepted by Europe.
Nerses Ketikyan also said that the Azerbaijani embassy had filed a complaint with the Bulgarian government on the various events of the Armenian community and had called on the Bulgarian government to prohibit the Armenians from organizing them.
“The Azerbaijani Ambassador is trying to limit our constitutional rights in every possible way; for this reason, the Armenians, at least at the moment, raised their voice of protest so that the ambassador of Azerbaijan is declared "persona non grata" by the Bulgarian government”,- Ketikyan said.
According to the Secretary of the Union of Armenians in Bulgaria, if the war in Artsakh continues, they will try to do even more.
For the independence of Artsakh. The Armenians organized a 7-day hunger strike in the United States
Armenian youth in Los Angeles are fighting for the recognition of Artsakh with new actions.
They organized a 7-day hunger strike demanding the American leadership to recognize the independence of Artsakh and stop selling arms to Azerbaijan and Turkey.
The hunger strike started at the beginning of the week, on Monday, and will last until Sunday and will end with a pan-Armenian march to the consulate of Azerbaijan.
“During the day, we carry out various activities with the involvement of our other members and compatriots.
On the very first day, we called for an end to the sale of Turkish goods in Armenian stores.
This has already received positive feedback”,-said the member of the Armenian Youth Federation of the Central Board of Western America Aram Manukyan in an interview with “Hayern Aysor”.
Every evening the Armenians gather, sing national liberation songs and deliver messages involving various political figures as well.
“We understand very well that what we do is nothing compared to the daily sacrifices of our soldiers.
This is our struggle in the political arena as Diaspora soldiers”,- he said.
The young people want everyone to make constant donations to the Hayastan Foundation, to raise their political voice in various ways, to continue diligent and collective work on social networks to get Artsakh recognized.
For the peace in Artsakh. Thousands of people took part in the march in Los Angeles
A march entitled “Artsakh is under attack. March in the Name of Peace” took place in Los Angeles. More than 150 thousand demonstrators took part in it.
The march was held along all the main avenues to the Turkish consulate.
“When we got to the last stop where we crossed the Los Angeles border to Beverly Hills we realized that it was a large-scale march. An unprecedented march in Los Angeles history”,- said the Member of the All-Armenian Council of Western America Vigen Hovsepyan.
The demonstration of many thousands was organized in 6 days.
According to Vigen Hovsepyan, they pursued three main goals: “First of all, we wanted to convey the voice of the protest of Armenians to the international community and tell about what is happening in Armenia and Artsakh.
The second goal was to bring our voice of protest to the international political arena.”
During the march, hundreds of thousands of Armenians demanded to put pressure on Azerbaijan and Turkey in order to achieve peace and to take measures for the recognition of independent Artsakh.
“The third goal was addressed to our soldiers fighting on the border, our brave army, our people, to say that today the Diaspora is the second army of Armenians, we are in the trenches with them, shoulder to shoulder, and we are ready to contribute and do everything what will be necessary: from donations to similar demonstrations and marces”,- Vigen Hovsepyan said.
According to Hovsepyan, there was also a fundraiser during the march and more than 100 thousand dollars were raised.
Franco-Armenian director Zhirayr Babazyan in homeland with cultural programs
The purpose of returning to Armenia from Paris was work.
French-Armenian director, actor Zhirayr Babazyan came with one job, other works followed one after another. And he stayed longer than he thought.
He has been in Armenia for 4 years.
The "Opera Mosaic" concert was recently held, which was prepared with great enthusiasm.
“This is also a great opportunity to meet our new generation, they are very talented, highly educated and decided to perform 9 excerpts from international operas.
“Three screenwriters have been invited, one of whom is me,” Babazyan said.
From theater to opera, from opera to theater, this transition always exists in the creative life of Zhirayr Babazyan.
He says that differences and similarities only complement each other.
“From time to time I even tell both sides: I tell the actors to learn a little from the opera singers how to get their voices heard without shouting, or I tell the opera singers to learn from the actors, this is everything should merge with each other, ”says the Armenian of French origin.
Zhirayr Babazyan also continues to act in films.
During this time, he starred in a film by Mikael Poghosyan, and in the near future he will star in another Armenian film.
In his words, one mission has been added to his main work in Armenia - work with the new generation.
“This new generation pleases me with the fact that I can do at least something in my life, give something useful and not only think about being good only for me, but also feel that that you are passing on something to others, "he says.
Currently, the French-Armenian director is taking care of the financing of culture in Armenia.
In his opinion, the theater especially needs a lot of support, for which more funds should be allocated.
On the other hand, he says that the Armenian theater lacks French lightness, which he is now trying to convey to novice representatives of the sphere
Free lessons of the Western Armenian language are held in the Tumanyan House-Museum
We speak Western Armenian.
The Tumanyan House-Museum is hosting a Western Armenian language lesson.
The Lecturer is the  Armenologist, expert in international relations, Avedis Aposhian.
He studied this branch of the Armenian language, now is the time to pass on the knowledge and experience.
“We don't want to teach only according to the textbook, to teach typical formal lessons, we want to have more discussions during the lesson; we must create a convenient and flexible schedule.
Basically, there will be readings and analysis of works of literature, we will focus on the spoken Western Armenian, but we will also not forget about the orthography,” said Avedis Aposhian.
According to the Armenologist, there is a problem with the comprehension and spread of the Western Armenian language in Armenia.
It needs to be developed here so that Armenia becomes the center for the preservation of the language.
“By preserving and developing it here, we must equally spread the language across all communities of the diaspora, and cooperate with them.
That is, to preserve the language by joint efforts.
It should not be so that each region has different spelling or grammatical forms from the other,” he said.
This is the first meeting of the group.
They have gathered to discuss questions and suggestions.
There are people of different ages in the group.
The youngest is a 10th-grade student Varduhi Vardanyan.
According to her, these lessons will help her to better understand the Western Armenian writers.
“The beauty of the Western Armenian language has always been interesting to me. When I found out about the lessons, I wanted to take part,” Varduhi said.
The Director of the House-Museum, Ani Yeghiazaryan, is sure that the Western Armenian language should be preserved first of all in Armenia, since it is the homeland of all of the Armenians around the world.
“Since Tumanyan has always emphasized the importance of uniting the two branches of the Armenian language, which together convey all the possible delights of the literary language, we decided to listen to Tumanyan's voice and try to fulfill his desire,” the director of the House-Museum said.
The Western Armenian language is included in the UNESCO list of endangered languages.
The director assures that by teaching the language and through a number of other initiatives, they will preserve the Western Armenian language.
They will meet again in a week and will begin the first lesson with Hagop Baronian's work "Esteemed Beggars".
The discussions will be conducted in Western Armenian.
Free the Armenian prisoners! The appeal of the diaspora and international organizations
The National Council of Christian Churches called on the United States to solve the problem of Armenian captives and provide immediate support to the people of Artsakh who were forced to flee their homes due to the recent war unleashed by Azerbaijan and Turkey.
“We call on the United States to actively negotiate the return of Armenian military personnel and civilians who have been remaining in captivity since the November 9 ceasefire.
We also call on all political and religious leaders in the United States to recognize the Armenian Genocide in the early 20th century” - the statement said.
The Council also condemned the destruction of churches and religious monuments noting that Azerbaijan is obliged to protect cultural heritage.
Human Rights Watch also stated that Armenian prisoners of war were tortured in Azerbaijan.
They were treated cruelly and humiliatingly.
The statement says that all prisoners of war and civilians in Azerbaijan must be immediately released.
Azerbaijan should also provide information on the whereabouts of military personnel and civilians.
“Torture and ill-treatment of Armenian prisoners of war is a terrible war crime. It is also deeply troubling that some Armenian servicemen have not been found despite being last seen in a prison in Azerbaijan” - Hugh Williamson, director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch said.
Human Rights Watch interviewed four released prisoners of war who described in detail the ill-treatment of them and other prisoners of war.
The organization said in the statement that there are many videos on the Internet in which Azerbaijani officers demonstrate the cruel treatment of Armenian prisoners of war.
And the Diaspora Armenians staged a protest in front of the Azerbaijani Embassy in the United States and the White House demanding the release of Armenian captives held in Azerbaijan.
French-Armenian journalist has created the first Armenian-French Internet channelShe left her homeland but did not forget about the importance of the Armenian culture and language. Nare Tadevosyan moved to France several years ago, dreaming of becoming a journalist and having her own Armenian programs.
“Many people come to France in search, and so did I. I am an English-Spanish translator by profession but I have always liked and followed journalism as well.
When I came here, my husband was working in this sphere, and I accordingly started working as a journalist” - Nare Tadevosyan said.
Being goal-oriented and creative, Nare decided to create the first Armenian-French internet channel in France.
“We started with the simplest. We have created an Armenian-French internet channel "Arménie Info" - news from Armenia.
The channel is broadcast in Armenian but there are some programs in French as well.
We represent cultural as well as political events that are directly related to Armenians or Armenia.
We also make several programs in cooperation with Armenian specialists and present the situation here” - Nare said.
In a very short time, the French and local French Armenians fell in love with the channel, and this became a new motivation for Nare to create a new culinary show.
“This is how the idea was born to create a show where I visit Armenian families in the Diaspora and learn the recipes from their grandmothers.
The program is called “My grandmother's recipes”, - Nare said.
Considering it important to preserve Armenian culture and loudly declaring about that, Nare and her husband presented the scientific and educational film "Treasures of Armenia" to the French-Armenian audience.
After positive reviews, a second bilingual film was shot as a result of the Armenian-French cooperation.
“This is a scientific and educational film, while watching which you will get an idea of who Armenian is.
We had great success, there were more than 40 shows in France, Canada, Belgium” - Nare Tadevosyan said.
Being far from her homeland, Nare creates in Armenian.
She reports diaspora news every week on the “News” program of the Public Television.
The most important thing for her is to contribute to the preservation of the Armenian identity and to fully present the Armenian culture abroad.

From 1920 to present: Azerbaijani atrocities in Shushi
The Church of the Holy Savior Ghazanchetsots in 1911 looked like this
The construction of the cathedral began in 1868 and was completed in 1887.
There were many lithographic inscriptions on the walls of the church, one of which stated that the architect of the cathedral was Simeon Ter-Hakobyants.
Ancient manuscripts and gilded guardian angels were kept here.
It was the huge embodiment of 19th-century Armenian culture.
After the Azerbaijani barbarities in 1972, the church looked like this
In the 1940s, the cathedral was used as a storehouse, then in the 1950s, the church dome was demolished and the church stones were dismantled.
In the 1970s, Azerbaijani barbarism reached its peak. In the territory of the church and inside, car tires were burnt, various explosive materials were left, alongside various Azerbaijani inscriptions that were left on the walls.
After the liberation of Shushi, the church was renovated and the destroyed dome was restored in 1998.
On October 8, 2020, the church was shelled by the Azerbaijani Air Force during the Second Artsakh War, which damaged the church dome.
After the war, after the Ghazanchetsots Church of the Holy Savior in Shushi came under Azeri control, the Azeris continued to desecrate it.
The massacre of Armenians in Shushi in the 1920s and its aftermath
The ruins of the Verin-Tagh district of Shushi from the southeast
In the first half of the 1920s, an unknown author photographed the ruins of the Armenian districts of Shushi.
Levon Mirzoyan, who was born in Karabakh, knowing that Azerbaijan did not intend to implement the decision to restore the city of Shushi, organized the shooting of the ruins of the city.
The photographs were saved and brought to Yerevan by Nina Abgarovna Mangasarovna, who was from Shushi, an employee of the library of the Baku branch of the Marxism-Leninism Institute.
The ruins of Aguletsots Saint Astvatsatsin Church in Shushi
Before the construction of Saint Ghazanchetsots Church, Aguletsots Church was the largest church in Shushi and was considered the Main Cathedral.
It was destroyed in March 1920.
In the 1960s, the Azeris demolished the church and built a school.
This was the memory of Marietta Shahinyan, a writer from Shushi
“In March 1920, 7000 houses were destroyed and burned here within three days.
The numbers are different, some say 3-4 thousand Armenians were massacred, others - more than 12 thousand.
The fact is that none of the 35,000 Armenians remained in Shushi,” Marietta Shahinyan wrote.
In a few photos, the Kanach Jam Church of Shushi stands out, which is visible from different parts of the city.
The church was also called Saint John the Baptist.
It is also known as the Karabakhtsis Church.
The name Kanach Jam is conditioned by the green dome of the church.
Later, due to the Azerbaijani regime, the church was turned into a hall for mineral water.
Then, after the end of the war in 2020, the Azerbaijanis completely demolished the domes of Kanach Jam.
The ruins of the Jraberdots district of Shushi are in the center, Kusanats Monastery.
This part of the city was called the Desert.
It was one of the oldest cultural structures.
The monastery was built in 1816.
It was ruthlessly demolished in 1960-1970.

From businessman to adviser to the President of Artsakh. The story of the repatriate Vahe Keushgeryan
Armenian Diaspora businessman  Vahe Keushguerian moves to live in Artsakh:
From Syria to Lebanon, from Lebanon to Italy, then to America, and the final stop in Armenia. Although he was born and raised in an Armenian family, for Vahe Keushguerian his homeland seemed to be something inaccessible until the moment he first came to Armenia and never wanted to leave it again.
“I didn't know what it was until I came to Armenia.
We had Ararat, Armenian music in our minds, we studied, read but there was no real connection with culture and our land.
You come to Armenia, go out for a walk in Yerevan early in the morning, look at Ararat and amaze”.
Young Vahe was interested in the world of wines.
His experience and knowledge in the field of winemaking will soon serve the Motherland; he will participate in the revival of the wine industry in Armenia.
“While in San Francisco, I started importing Italian and French wines to California.
Four years later, I decided to go to Italy and start making wine: I found a garden, a factory and started making wine.
I first came to Armenia in 1997 and immediately fell in love with it.
It was like some kind of virus that remained in me, and I bought land and planted a garden”.
Vahe Keushguerian returned to Armenia with many ideas, started various projects, one successful, the other not.
However, he always continued his efforts with boundless optimism and in 2011 founded WineWorks.
Remembering his journey to Armenia from abroad, he realizes that it was not so easy but the desire to fulfill his dream was stronger.
“It was not a problem, it was a risk.
I remember that day well.
We came to Italy with my wife, 11 month old twin children who could not walk yet, 2 dogs, 1 cat, 10 suitcases.
I told my wife that we need to forget about that day, as it was hard, we were with children, etc., and such moments are quickly forgotten when you strongly believe in a dream”.
Karas, Kataro, Zorah, Kyosh, Zulal, Oshin. Vahe Keushguerian took part in the creation of various winemaking projects but in addition to winemaking, he participated in a number of other projects: EVN Report magazine, Impact Hub, Yerevan Wine Academy.
Now he has another important mission. He will participate in the implementation of a number of development programs as an advisor to the President of Artsakh.
“On the one hand, there are different organizations that want to make investments, donations, charity, on the other hand, there are people in different villages and communities of Artsakh who have different needs. It's my job to bring it all together”.
Now the daughter is engaged in the family wine-making business, the son is a future winemaker.
Both are in Armenia and will continue living and working in their homeland, and Vahe Keushguerian will soon move to Stepanakert.
He says there is still a lot of work to be done but the most important is that people keep believing, there is no time to despair.

From the 1988 earthquake to our days, Armenian movie director about his memories of the Motherland and upcoming movies
Armenian movie director Sarik Andreasyan moved from Armenia to Kazakhstan in 1988 after the Spitak earthquake.
The most impressionable memories of the earthquake are people's panic, broken windows, grief: “I remember everything - how my relatives went to help, coffins that were everywhere in the city.
I was four years old then, we were in Yerevan.
I was in kindergarten when the windows broke down” - he said.
Years later, in 2015, Sarik decided to make a movie about the earthquake.
According to him, it was one of the highest-grossing movies in Russia over the past 30 years, the most successful one.
The director has been interested in movies since he was a kid: “I was a calm child, I was not a bully, I watched a lot of movies. At some point, I became even more interested and started buying magazines with articles about movies.
One can tell some stories in the movie.
Movie is an interesting story itself, so maybe I just had a desire to tell stories."
Having moved to Moscow, Sarik Andreasyan directed the movie “Dumbs”: “This was my first movie that received good reviews.
Then I was invited to direct the “Office Romance”, which was also a success."
The Armenian movie director considers the Hollywood movie "American Heist" with Adrian Brody to be one of the most important movies in his career.
In the future, the movie director plans to make a movie about the participation of Armenians in the Great Patriotic War.
Back then, about 600 thousand Armenians went to war, there are even documentaries about how Armenians dance "Kochari" near the Reichstag: "My story is about Armenian musicians going to war who dance" Kochari" at the end.
Sarik Andreasyan says that he visits Armenia often.
Before the pandemic, he traveled to Western Armenia to make video materials.
The director set himself the task of collecting all the videos and making a documentary about historical Armenia and Armenians.
From the Netherlands to Armenia. How Narek Aramyan returned to his homeland and founded a technology company
To return to Armenia, start a company, do well in business. Narek Aramyan returned to Armenia and founded the technology company “Storegear” after living in the Netherlands for many years.
“Since 2014, we have created our own organization that develops a program and we sell it to supermarkets, delivery organizations.
They deliver through our program or if it is an online supermarket, collect online orders through our program and deliver.
Since we were growing, we had to decide where to open a branch and hire employees to continue to develop",- said Narek in an interview with “Hayern Aysor”.
It was then, in 2018, that the “Neruzh” program was launched for the first time in Armenia which provided an opportunity for Armenian entrepreneurs to create a startup.
Narek decided to participate in the program: “It was a very good chance and it gave us the opportunity to get to know the Armenian market, Armenian youth, to some extent, get to know the government.
And it turned out that our idea, the program that we had been developing since 2014, was good enough and thus we were among the winners".
The "Storegear" company has opened a branch in Armenia at the expense of a state grant.
The company has created 12 working positions the number of which should increase: “At the moment we have 12 employees, all of them are Armenians, half of them are girls; we can say that this is very good because the number of women in IT is very small abroad.
If Germany, the Netherlands and America find out that half of our workforce is girls, they will be amazed.
We expect to have 20-25 employees in about a year".
During the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus the company did not incur large losses due to effective management.
The young businessman is currently in the Netherlands. A new product is being created but Narek prefers to talk about it later when the work is complete.
From Vanadzor to Brazil. How Arthur Haroyan’s career as an actor began in BrazilHow he got to Brazil from Vanadzor, he did not understand himself.
Since childhood, actor Arthur Haruyan has been convincing everyone that he will go and get acquainted with actor Arasi Balabanyan and other actors of Brazilian serials.
His dream came true in 2008.
“And the Armenian drama began. My mother fainted, my grandmother got worse, scandals, etc., because no one expected that moment to come,” Arthur said.
Arthur did not receive an acting education in Armenia.
He studied at the Department of Russian language and literature of the Vanadzor State University, received practical acting knowledge at the Drama Theater named after Hovhannes Abelyan.
The first performance was “Autumn sun” by Hrant Matevosyan, in which he personified the image of Simon.
In the courtyard he was known as Little Simon or Brazil’s Arthur.
“It was like I knew everyone in Brazil, but the reality was somewhat different from these fantasies.
When I arrived, I had very little money, I came to Brazil as a tourist,” Arthur Haroyan said.
Arthur worked as a teacher of Armenian languages and literature in one of the Armenian schools in San Paulo.
Then he realized his next dream- entered a theater school.
He formed the cast named “Arka” (available) and presented to the audience his first performance “1915”.
“Brazil was very welcomed, not only the Armenian community, but also many Brazilians came to see the play, as this topic is unfamiliar to Brazilians.”
“Brazilian actresses of my cast were singing in Armenian Dle yaman.
This probably says it all, it just thrilled every time during this scene,” said Arthur.
Arthur has also starred in many Brazilian films, commercials.
The actor’s life, dreams, difficulties and successes have recently been summarized in his autobiographical book.
I will give all the income for this book to the All-Armenian Hayastan Foundation to give those families who are in a bad situation because of this last war,” Arthur said.
Before the epidemic, the actor received an offer to star in the film.
However, the shooting was not carried out due to the restrictions in the country.
My image was that I had to be bald, I went, had my hair cut, a week later they did a lockdown all over Brazil, and I was sitting at home hairless.
This is Arthur’s new occupation. On one of the Brailian TV channels, he prepares Armenian dishes and talks about Armenian cuisine.
Of course I was cooking spas with tan, dolma, everything.
I think it will be in the second or third season,” he said.
The actor considers it his permanent job to tell foreigners about Armenia.
Brazilian friends are told where Armenia is, what its history is.
He visits Armenia every year. Goes to the theater, meets his friend.
They will also tour with the cast and perform with a new play.
Arthur works with Brazilian and Argentinian directors and has a new goal: to make a film based on his autobiographical book.

The turkish demokrathaber.org has reported this topic.
Paylan asked the Parliament the following questions:
"- Have you started an investigation regarding the assassination attempt against me in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey?”
- How many times and on which exact dates has Mehmet Sinan Ince partipicated in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey since 2010?
- Which deputies have made it possible for Mehmet Sinan Ince to participate in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey?
- If Mehmet Sinan Ince was not registered to enter the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, then who invited him into the Assembly?
- Regarding Mehmet Ince’s assassination plan, who is the MP’s advisor who was mentioned in the statement “The case is turned from the advisor”?
- As part of the planned and revealed assassination attempt against me in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, have you investigated from whom the person had acquired the weapon?
- Have you caught the camera footage of Mehmet Ince saying “We have made preparations for everything"?"
Garo Paylan reported the crime to the General Prosecutor's Office in Ankara.
The report is related to the lawyer Mehmet Sinan Ince, who has reportedly developed an assassination plan against Paylan in 2016.
Lawyer Mehmet Sinan Ince wrote on his Instagram page that weapons should have been taken to the Turkish parliament to kill Garo Paylan.
Garoon Tech makes the farmer's work easierWhat if one day a programmer and a gardener meet? There will be the following.
A specialist of "Garoon Tech" and a gardener of Voskepar are in the frame.
It turns out that the garden can also be maintained using high technology.
Meet Hayk Badalyan.
He brought "Garoon" to Armenia from the Netherlands when he saw that agriculture can also be developed with the help of technology.
“In the Netherlands emotions were the first thing captured, not technology.
I saw how pleasant and easy it can be for gardeners there and then I remembered how hard they have to work here. "
The “Garoon Tech” formula is simple. The gardener takes a picture of a sick plant, sends it to the specialist using the app and receives advice.
Both sides benefit.
The gardener gets quick and accurate advice and the specialist makes money remotely.
“The consulting platform is currently being tested in the regions.
Part of our team is there conducting tests, collecting opinions. "
The idea became a reality thanks to the “Neruzh” program.
In 2018, Hayk decided to return to Armenia from the Netherlands and take part in the first program.
Yet, he got lucky when he participated  for the second time.
With a state grant Hayk and his friend founded “Garoon Tech” and then hired employees.
Now there are 12 of them.
“We talked with a variety of leading experts, listened to advice.
Sponsors of “Neruzh” helped to register our company."
The program will be ready this year.
The next step is to process the data and launch an automated system.
The robots will also take care of the gardens.
Ghazarian trial against Turkey to be continued in California 
Despite Ankara’s complaints to the US State Department of Foreign Affairs, the Central California District Court has decided to continue the legal process against the Turkish authorities in the name of father and son Ghazarians.
In 2018, after the trial opened in the names of Pargev and Karo Ghazaryan, for violating religious and cultural rights, Ankara not only refused to take over the court documents sent to it, but also demanded its immediate suspension.
The documents were handed over to Turkey last year, which sent them back without a response.
Thus, the court confirmed Ankara to be familiar with the documents, which serve as the basis for continuing the trial, perhaps for a verdict condemning Turkey.
The issue arose when Turkish agents threatened to put pressure on Pargev Ghazarian in Glendale, when he according to his religious and cultural rights, tried to visit the historical pilgrimage Kessab Palace, which is currently in Turkey.

Gor Sahakyan became the European Weightlifting Champion: exclusive interviews from the championship
During the European Weightlifting Championship in Yerevan, 19-year-old Gor Sahakyan became the European champion, registering 320 kg in the two-stroke.
“The impressions are great. This is what I was waiting for; thank God it came true.
I thank those who believed in me and my victory”, said Gor Sahakyan in a conversation with the journalists.
According to Gor, the competition was very intensive, and he did not expect that he would win with a 15 kg advantage.
Arayik Harutyunyan, head of the staff of the RA Prime Minister, and chairman of the European Weightlifting 2023 Organising Committee, believes that Gor Sahakyan’s victory came at the right time and in the right place.
“After the tension of the last few days, this victory was significant in several ways.
First of all, to leave that tension behind, because the troubles that had happened had to be removed, and our fans should be encouraged to come to the championships more”, said Arayik Harutyunyan in a conversation with “Hayern Aysor”.
ESCS Deputy Minister, Karen Giloyan, said that after looking at and analysing the list of athletes, it was clear to them that Gor has a genuine chance to win.
“He is a fighter, an athlete in good shape.
I had absolute faith that Gor would become a champion.
I thought it would be a serious fight because the Turkish opponents were neither bad weightlifters. And they could have dictated a tactical fight.
It was a very nervous competition. They gave fluctuations in kilograms, and they tried to weaken each other, and break them psychologically, but our team endured that tension. It has a strategy.
Having good tactics, we could always manage to reach the goal”, said Karen Giloyan.
The three gold medals won by Gor Sahakyan were the first in the men’s team.
In the men’s 67 kg weight category, the athlete successfully lifted 140 kg, then 145 kg, and became a minor gold medalist.
Gor Sahakyan successively lifted 170 kg and 175 kg, in the push exercise.
And in this exercise, he also won gold

Labor and Social Affairs Minister Mesrop Arakelyan stated at the government meeting that coordinated and targeted measures will be taken.

And in the near future, prosthetics will be carried out in groups, in parallel with this, measures will be taken to adapt home conditions to the problems of people with disabilities”.
After the approval of the program, the government discussed the issue of regulating the activities of fishermen on Lake Sevan.
The Minister of the Environment stressed that the program is aimed at the correct distribution and use of fish and crayfish stocks.
According to the Prime Minister, this will create a new platform for cooperation between fishermen and the state.
“Government measures to ensure the natural reproduction and development of fish stocks in Lake Sevan, in the end, are not taken for members of the government, these measures are primarily aimed at ensuring the normal activities of our compatriots and the development of this industry".
There is good news for agriculture too. The Minister of the Environment said that this year there will be no problems with water resources.
This is also due to the rise in the water level in Lake Sevan. "With the forecast for this year, I can say that, in comparison with the previous decades, we will register a new unprecedented mark - 1901 meters."
At the end of the government meeting, the Prime Minister added that this year it is necessary to implement programs pointwise in order to maintain the positive indicator of agricultural development.

The government also approved the procedure for providing financial support to citizens registered or actually living in Artsakh for a period of 4 months.
This means that all citizens of Artsakh, except for men aged 18-63 who do not have a disability group, will receive 68 thousand drams monthly.

The number of coronavirus cases has increased in Armenia.
During the government meeting, the Minister of Health noted that 748 out of 4285 tests carried out the day before had a positive result.
“Currently, the number of our active cases is 6772 of which 901 are hospitalized. At the moment, we have 9 medical centers that serve patients with coronavirus and we currently have about 100 free beds” - Minister of Health Anahit Avanesyan said.

After assessing the epidemic situation, the government discussed the issue of attracting new companies to the free economic zone "Ecos".
The Prime Minister noted that IT companies are also beginning to be active in the regions.

From now on, business entities will be able to receive VAT refunds every month.
This change will improve the overall VAT payment process.

Government meeting. The support program for hosts receiving Artsakh people has been extended
The three-month program of compensating for the hospitality costs of citizens who lost their homes during the Second Artsakh War was replaced by a six-month one.
During the meeting of the government, Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Mesrop Arakelyan said that the program according to which citizens receiving Artsakh people in Armenia received 30 thousand drams per adult, and those receiving in Artsakh - 45 thousand drams has been in effect since December.
In total, about 3,000 hosts receive monthly support for hosting over 7,000 citizens.
“In addition, the Artsakh people are partially settled in hotels, and we also have a program according to which we reimburse the costs of hotels.
Some of them live in state-owned properties the costs of which are also covered by the state” - the minister stressed.
In response to the Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s question about the results of the program the Minister noted that the technical problems that arose in the process had been resolved, and the criteria had been greatly simplified.
“That is, the hosts send an electronic request, the fact of ownership is checked in the cadastre database, and without any additional documents and agreements the hosts fill out a bank account to which the money is transferred.
In total, within the framework of this program, the hosts receive about 15 thousand people from Artsakh” - the minister said.
According to other programs, 25-30 thousand Artsakh people temporarily live in Armenia.
Mesrop Arakelyan added that the day before, 68 thousand drams support was provided to 80 thousand residents of Artsakh for a total of 5.5 billion drams; the support is ongoing.
Government members also discussed the results of the second economic measure against coronavirus through which the state subsidizes agricultural loans up to 1 million drams.
Economy Minister Vahan Kerobyan proposed to extend the program until October 1, 2021, until they are fully confident that agriculture and the economy in general have been restored.
“We made this decision because, having studied the statistics, we came to the conclusion that the pace of the process of issuing small agricultural loans is not the same as last year” - the Prime Minister noted.
Nikol Pashinyan noted that by this process they stimulate the citizens engaged in agriculture to receive loans on more favorable terms.
Government meeting. There are changes in programs to address the economic consequencesDuring the government meeting, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan noted that the increase in the number of coronavirus infected people is worrying.
Health Minister Anahit Avanesyan presented statistics and stressed that it is necessary to return to strict adherence to the regime of wearing masks and other preventive measures.
“As of yesterday, 491 positive cases were found out of 2922 tests which is 16%.
If at the beginning of January and February we had 5-7% positive cases among the tested, now, as you can see, there is an increase.
According to our forecasts, this number will increase next week”.
The Prime Minister asked about the procurement of the vaccine.
Anahit Avanesyan noted that the process of purchasing vaccines is going slowly but the import of the first batch is planned in the near future.
“Negotiations with the Russian side on the first batch have been completed.
The contract is in the process of signing, we expect the import of this batch within the next month”.
The government has approved amendments to two measures to address the economic impact of the coronavirus.
Minister of Economy Vahan Kerobyan noted that about 800 economic entities received loans in the amount of 9 billion but there is a need to make the terms of loaning more flexible.
“Most of the economic entities did not take advantage of the grace period, and in the conditions of the protracted economic crisis, such a need arose.
The change will not affect the budget but will significantly simplify loaning terms and allow our partners to be able to act freely”.
According to another project, the government will allocate over 200 million drams to the Tavush region.
By the end of the year, constructions in the border villages of Chinari, Nerkin Karmiraghbyur, Aygepar of Tavush region will be completed.

Government session. 7.5 billion drams to Artsakh, entertainment centers in the regionsThe government allocated 7 billion 548 thousand drams to the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs to finance the 4-month assistance program provided to the citizens of Artsakh.
“More than 101,000 Artsakhis received support under this assistance program last month.
I also want to remind that, according to the government regulations, there is no need to apply additionally every month, as the citizens who applied in March, in the upcoming months, the money will be automatically transferred to their bank accounts on the 20th of each month,” said Mesrop Arakelyan.
Entertainment and cultural centers will be established for young people in the regions.
6 centers applied for grants.
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan emphasized that they have decided to promote the creation of such an environment with this program.
“At an X moment, we registered that in most of the regions of the Republic there are no centers where the youth, let’s say the simplest thing, has the opportunity to gather and have discussions.
Such opportunities, if we roughly describe them, are mainly built around food. We saw the gap that centers should be created in the regions, where the content will be at the core,” said the Prime Minister.
The Minister of Economy, Vahan Qerobyan, noted that the creation of such centers will also contribute to remote work.
“Very often it is not convenient to work from home because of bad internet or bad environment.
Recently I also worked remotely, it is not easy when children are around,” said the minister.
“Especially newborns, they bother a lot, don't they?” the Prime Minister added.
The government discussed the project of making January 2-7 working days.
According to the Minister of Economy, the regulation is aimed at building a strong economy.
“With the adoption of this law, our annual GDP will increase by 88 billion drams or about 1.5%, the gross enumeration volume will increase by 123 billion drams, of which trade output will increase by 47.5 billion drams, industry output - 35.4, services output - 33.9 billion drams.” - mentioned the minister.
According to the Prime Minister, the project is connected not only with economic but also with health problems.
He mentioned that it is necessary to devote a lot of time to the discussion, to check the moods of the society.
“Dear colleagues, I suggest not to panic about the proposal, I want to state that this is a long-mature topic to be discussed, with the difference that every time it starts to be discussed in the second half of December,” Nikol Pashinyan added.
Mesrop Arakelyan contradicted the data presented by Vahan Qerobyan.
According to him, this change will ensure a significant decline in the sphere of domestic tourism and service.
“Mr. Qerobyan, in your substantiation you calculate the gross domestic product numbers only on working days, there is an impression that on non-working days no gross domestic product is produced in Armenia.
Some of these regulations, even, I say, in two spheres, trade and services, will ensure a significant decline in the gross domestic product,” the minister emphasized.
“On one hand, you are right, but on the other hand, I can say that many restaurants and shops are closed on those days. In general, everything stands in the way, so I would not question these numbers.” Qerobyan answered.
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan suggested to put the draft into circulation anyway, to study the public discussions, and come to a professional conclusion at the end.
Government session. All those involved in the improper storage of soldiers' relics were fired
The issue of improper storage of the relics of servicemen in the Abovyan Forensic Medical Center was discussed at the government session.
Acting Minister of Health Anahit Avanesyan first said that in the past there were no branches even in the regions, and since 2018 such centers have been built in Goris, Sevan, Metsamor and other cities, and the refrigerators have been equipped with new laboratory equipment.
“I must mention that, before 2018, there was no device for conducting genetic research at all. In 2018, thanks to the joint efforts of several departments, the first segmentator was purchased and installed,” said the ministress.
Avanesyan mentioned that there were also changes in the budget, the salaries of the employees increased by 25%.
“In 2017, the total budget amounted to 389 million drams, in the first months of 2018, it was reduced by 24 million drams and became 364 million drams. In 2019, it will be 481 million, in 2020 594 million drams,” said the ministress.
Pashinyan explained why these shortcomings occurred as a result of so many positive changes:
“Because we change the system, but it is not easy to change a person, what is important here is the problem of thinking.
Such a system did not exist in Armenia at all, before 2018. Hence, we have started the establishment of that system,” Pashinyan said.
Nikol Pashinyan said that all the people related to the incident in Abovyan morgue were fired.
“Yes, we should also learn lessons from this case, but on the other hand, I say one more time that the government or the Minister of Health cannot go and check everywhere, every day.
This is a matter of education and professional ethics,” Pashinyan said.
According to Pashinyan, the work of DNA research has now reached the final stage.
Now there are bodies that have not been identified, there are about 50 relics, from which DNA has not been separated from several experiments.
In this regard, Pashinyan said that they should apply to international partners.
The members of the government also discussed budget issues.
The President of State Revenues informed that the tax revenues collected in Armenia during the first 5 months of 2021 made 618.4 billion drams.
“These indicators have a positive difference compared to the data of 2020 and 2019, 618.4 billion collected revenues are 47.2 billion more than in 2019, 34.8 billion drams more than the comparable data of 2020,” said the Chairman of the State Revenue Committee.
The government adopted a bill to increase the number of judges in the judiciary.
According to Rustam Badasyan, a total of 62 positions will be added:
“With the help of this toolkit, the formation of new courts is envisaged by new procedures, which will increase public confidence in the judiciary. With the toolkit of e-justice, we are significantly unloading the judiciary,” the minister said.
According to the minister, with this project they will be able to carry out the investigation of the cases in a reasonable timeframe.
Government session: state budget revenues exceededThe government session began with economic important news.
Nikol Pashinyan, the Prime Minister said that the state budget revenues have been exceeded and the trade turnover has increased.
“Thus, the volume of trade turnover compared to the first quarter of last year increased by more than 8%, compared to March 2020, the trade turnover to March 2021 increased by 20%, that is the tax revenues of the budget are exceeded by 22.3 billion drams than planned, according to the results of the first quarter, the Ministry of Finances suggests to increase the forecast of state budget revenues by 40 billion drams,” the Prime Minister said.
The chairman of the SRC added, “the difference in sales turnover is 26.1%, and the number of transactions is 23.8%.”
Tavush Governor Hayk Chobanyan resigned and will replace the Minister of High-Tech Industry Hakob Arshakyan.
“I want to thank Mr. Arshakyan for the work done.
In fact, a new ministry was created and formed which is a quite complex job and is done good enough.
I would like to wish success to Mr. Chobanyan as the Minister of High-Tech Industry,” the Prime Minister said.
The tuition fees for children and spouses of persons who participated in the war, have been compensated.
The Minister of ESCS, Vahram Dumanyan, said that a total of 205 million drams were allocated to 1.373 beneficiaries.
“The proposed decision provides for the payment of another 590 million drams for 2840 beneficiaries.” the Minister said.

Hayastan All-Armenian Fund denied rumors about the embezzlement of $8 million
Hayastan All-Armenian Fund responded to the false news about the fund with a post on Facebook.
“The discrediting disinformation campaign concerning the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund continues, therefore we consider it necessary to urge once again not to believe the disinformation in the press undermining the image of the Fund.
In particular, this concerns the information in the press that the international audit did not approve the expenses presented by the Ministry of Finance to the Fund. This is absurd and misinformation, since the international audit is still ongoing.
Another common claim that the $8 million from the fund was cashed and embezzled is also false.
The All-Armenian Fund continues its activities for the prosperity of Armenia, Artsakh and the Diaspora.
It should also be noted that an online meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund at which current issues will be discussed and decisions will be made will be held today.
The press service of the fund will make a final report on the results of the meeting” - the fund stated.

After the April-2016 war, he bought an apartment in Armenia to visit his homeland more often.
Even after the 44-day Artsakh war, he decided to have his contribution and to implement projects in Armenia.
“My goal was to buy land, build it with American comfort, Mediterranean colors and design, get beautiful apartments with at least 80% Armenian raw materials.”
The apartments are in Yerevan and different regions.
All of them are designed for the Diasporan-Armenians, so they return to Armenia, buy and live here, as he did.
Now he has a restaurant in Yerevan. They serve various dishes of Asian cuisine.
They decided to name the restaurant “Janfo”.
“Jan” is the well-known “Jan-Jigyar”, without which Armenianness can neither survive, nor give flavor to our customers, and “Fo” is a type of a Vietnamese soup that is spread all over the world.”
Hovhannes Mkhjian now wants to move his business from Lebanon to Armenia.
He has already adapted to Armenia.
He also calls on Armenians living far from the homeland to first ask themselves what they can do to improve the situation in Armenia, and then work together to invest in the homeland.

In other words, I do this for the sake of the children.
For example, this is a pastry with ordinary cheese, but I made it colorful to make the children happy.
It is Easter, it is a holiday! These colors raise people's mood," says Pegi Lepejian.
Both in Syria and in Armenia, repatriates celebrate the holiday in the same way.
In addition to eggs, sweets are put on the table as well.
Each time the hostess surprises the guests with her preferences.
She says that in comparison with Syria, people like having a table full of food in Armenia.
"As you say, we do not have rice with raisins.
But, yes, they used to prepare it in the old days. Here, that tradition is more emphasized.
To be honest, I liked it very much, hence, we also make rice with raisins now," says Pegi Lepejian.
When everything is ready, the family gathers at the table.
The painted eggs are ready, and the family can start the game.

Two Armenians were seriously injured and taken to hospital.
In an interview with “Hayern Aysor”, Arsen Shpilberg said that he had been hit on the head and other parts of the body several times.
He only defended himself and did not fight back because he realized that by this provocation the Azerbaijanis were clearly trying to show as if the demonstration of Armenians was not peaceful.
According to the protesters, the Armenians living in Israel are doing their best to be useful in this war but are confident that their work cannot be compared with the courage and devotion to the homeland of the Armenian soldier.

Eduard Ayvazyan says that they are ready to help the Armenians of Artsakh at any cost, by any means, so that Artsakh survives in this struggle and the Armenians of Artsakh are not subjected to genocide, and so that they definitely appear victorious.
It is time to impose sanctions on Azerbaijan for war crimes. Tankian
The soloist of “System of a Down” rock band Serj Tankian made a post on his Facebook page, sharing the publication of the Armenian National Committee of Australia.
“It is time to impose sanctions on Azerbaijan for the usage of “Formula One” and other actions, as this dictatorship has committed war crimes and continues to do so with impunity,” Tankian wrote.
The publication of the Armenian National Committee of Australia states that the dictator of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev is abusing human rights, and the world is silent about it.
“The international community must wake up and see the reality where the cost of one person’s life for #AutocratAliyev is equal to a Grand Prix ticket,” the statement said.

Why “The Kingdom of God”?

The Kingdom of God also coincides with the title of one of my verses, which was dedicated to Ejmiatsin, the place of my birth.
I decided to organize the presentation of my book in Yerevan, since Yerevan is the cornerstone of literature, science and culture for me, Armenia has always been dictating and I also wanted to be its bearer, so that our cultural and scientific activities could start in Armenia,” Khurshudyan said.
One of the poems of the book is dedicated to Khachatur Abovyan.
According to the autho, the goal is to make Abovyan’s life, episodes of death, and versions recognisable to the reader.
According to him, Abovyan is the person who accompanies an Armenian in his adult life and helps to preserve his identity until the last breath.
The editor-in-chief of the book, Armen Avanesyan, highlighted the work of Karen Khurshudyan in preserving the Armenian identity, which, according to him, is also visible in the book.
“Karen Khurshudyan set a goal not only to create poetry, but also to educate, bring up young people, Armenian children, and worked purposefully in this direction.
His book is an exceptional achievement and is sure to leave a useful mark,” the editor said.
The presentation was attended by cultural figures from different spheres.
Many of the guests recited poems from the book, and also dedicated their own poems to the author.
Khurshudyan said that all proceeds from the book will be used for the development of the Abovyan Gymnasium.
Various poems of the book have been translated into different languages: English, Persian and French.
Karen Khurshudyan said that a book will be published soon, which will include translated versions.
There is also a goal to fully translate the book into French.

Karo Kebabjyan was posthumously awarded the Order of “Mesrop Mashtots”
Permanent representative of the Republic of Artsakh to the Middle East, Karapet Kebabjian was posthumously awarded the Order of “Mesrop Mashtots”.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Artsakh Davit Babayan presented the order to Kebabjian’s son in “Yerablur”, where father’s body is buried.
“Karo Kebabjian’s life itself was a reflection of the history of our people.
Originating from Western Armenia, his parents escaped the Genocide, came and settled in Lebanon and got back on their feet.
Mr. Kebabjian’s father was a famous group leader who performed many feats during our self-defense work in the Middle East.
Karo Kebabjian participated in that case with the same enthusiasm,” said Davit Babayan.
Artur Khachatryan, Member of the Supreme Body of the ARFD of Armenia, stressed that from the very first days of the Artsakh War, Comrade Karo was in Armenia, offering his services, abilities, knowledge and skills, encouraging the soldiers.
“It is not surprising that since 1999, the representative of Artsakh in the Middle East believed in Artsakh, the victory of Artsakh, and with his word and deed, wanted to make Artsakh a happy city.
Perhaps, he was one of the first investors who contributed to Shushi and founded a hotel in Shushi,” said Artur Khachatryan.
In his words, in connection with Karvachar, he had big plans that he had to implement with Karapet Kebabjian.

Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages
“We can safely say, if there were no Lazaryans and Nerses Ashtaraketsi, the Russian Armenians would still be buried in the Asian darkness for a very long time.
Their schools were inviting us to life.
Thanks to these schools a spring morning opened up on the darkness of the Armenian horizon.
They were twins, they thought and acted alike.
Their religion was the same, both followed the same path.” These are the words of the Armenian historian, publicist, professor Leo about the rich Lazarians in Moscow.
In the late Middle Ages there were many Armenian Aristocratic families in Russia.
They received aristocratic titles.
Rich Lazarians were one of these dynasties, engaged in silk mining and mining.
At their expense, one of the largest Armenian and Oriental research and educational centers was founded in 1815.
Armenian, Russians, Georgians and representatives of other nations studied here without discrimination on the basis of nationality and religion.

The Lazaryans made a great contribution to the development of the Russian theater.
In 1872, the seminary opened the Department of Oriental Languages as a high university education.
Although the seminary already had the status of a university, it was still called Lazarev Seminary.
Well-known Armenians- Mkrtich Emin, Grigor Khalatyan, Karapet and Hovsep Lusikyan, Karo Melik-Ohanjanyan, Tsolak Khanzadyan, Poghos Makintsyan, Raphael Patkanyan, Vahan Teryan, Smbat Shahaziz,Vardges Surenyants, Yeghishe Tadevosyan, from Russians- Ivan Turgenev, Lev Tolstoy, Yuri Veselovsky, Konstantin Stanislavsky, Mikhail Glinka, Ruben Simonov studied here.

Lebanese newspaper "Azdak"
The Armenian trace in Lebanon confirms that Armenians have been present in the country since the 1st century BC.
The modern Lebanese-Armenian community was formed mainly during the years of the Armenian Genocide and continued developing after that.
Especially after Lebanon gained independence, the Armenians were able to stand out not only in the sphere of economy, culture, but also in the sphere of politics.
In different years, the Armenian community has always been represented in the country's parliaments by its deputies, and in the government by Armenian ministers.
In Lebanon, the Armenian press especially has rich traditions and a long history.
One can get acquainted with interesting topics related to events in the country and in Armenia in many magazines, quarterly collections, yearbooks, weekly newspapers.
Among them, the newspapers “Azdak”, “Zartonk” and “Ararat” stand out.
The “Vana Dzain” and “Radio Sevan” radio stations also operate around the clock in Lebanon.
Azdak is a national, literary, socio-political newspaper, which is being published since 1927.
At first, it came out once every three days, since 1930 - once every two days, and since 1932 - every day.
Hayk Palyan was the founder-owner-director.
Currently, Shakhan Gantakharyan is the head and chief editor of the newspaper.
The newspaper covers Armenian, Lebanese and international political, economic, cultural, scientific and sports events.
It consisted of the literary "Hardgogh", "Azdak Saturday", "Azdak Sport" sections.

Lebanese-Armenian Arminé Panosyan returned to her homeland and founded a training centerThus, every day repatriate Arminé Panosyan receives dozens of students in her educational center.
Teaches how to write, read, listen and communicate in English.
Arminé has returned to her homeland from Lebanon, she has been living here for 5 years already:
"There was always that desire to repatriate, but there had to be conditions, because we have a family, we have children, in my case my biggest motivation was my child, that I did not want him to grow up in Lebanon like us, in the Diaspora, in a very unstable, insecure situation," she said.
At first, it was difficult.
She started with only one desk and a lampshade in a small room, then invested her income and founded this center.
"I always wanted to have my own language center, not only for language teaching, but also for development and training. It was not  possible to have it in Lebanon, it needed a huge amount of money. Here, however, it was possible to start with a smaller amount."
After working in various schools and publishing houses in Lebanon, Arminé wanted to bring 23 years of professional experience to Armenia.
New teaching methods and skills, at first, contradicted the teaching methods prevalent in Armenia.
According to the specialist, not everyone believed that her methods would work.
"Some people doubted, some thought I was lying, when I said we only speak English in class, they said: How will our children understand you, how will they communicate with you? It will not work, it will not happen, I listened too much not”!
After seeing the result, they believed, trusted, now they advise each other to study here.
The number of students increased from 9 to more than 100.
Now, in addition to English, they also teach Russian, Spanish and Armenian for foreigners.
Most of the teachers are also repatriates.
And the name of the center has its clear explanation:
"A+ is the best grade in the American system.
When I thought of “A+ Skills”, I meant that the students and pupils who come here get the best language skills," said Arminé.
After 5 years of work, they already cooperate with various international organizations.
This year the second branch of the center was opened.
They want to establish a pre-school development center in the near future, where children will be able to develop their language skills.

He says that the Diaspora Armenians do not know much about Armenia, so many are afraid and refuse to move to their homeland.
And Hakob proved by his own example that success can be achieved in Armenia.
Two years ago he founded the “Big Mind” training center.
“Every person should have the ability to think or, to be more precise, the ability to adapt, so that not to get disappointed right away but to move further learning the skills of comprehending thoughts” - Hakob said.
As a coach in body language and non-verbal communication, Hakob Makdis traveled to the regions of Armenia, Artsakh and taught young people life skills.
During the war, Hakob and his team actively participated in the information war sharing news and analytics in different languages with the countries of the Middle East.
“We have a new idea.
We have created a foreign language media Armarabia which is a research center as well.

Hakob Makdis is sure that every Armenian should contribute to the development of the homeland.

Made in Armenia. Diaspora Armenians' products are presented in the recently opened National shopping mallThe idea of presenting and selling Armenian products on one site is already a reality. The products presented in the National shopping mall are exclusively of Armenian origin and are intended for those who prefer local products.
More than 250 brands are represented there some of which are from diaspora producers.
Daniel Ghevondyan - businessman
“We have already been on the market for 3-4 years, and the National shopping mall stimulated to develop our production; since the goal is to present only Armenian products, and nothing is imported from abroad, we, in turn, decided to certainly get our own pavilion there” - Daniel Ghevondyan said.
“Our “Bouquet” product which contains 5 types of fruit is also presented there. Instead of 100 grams, the customer can choose the 300 gram package with all kinds of fruit of various flavors which also look beautiful on the table” - Daniel said.
From dried apples with cinnamon to dried tomatoes and oranges. Each Armenian fruit and vegetable can be dried to make a unique tasty and flavored product in a beautiful "Chreni" package.
And the presented products will be of interest not only for Armenians: tourists and Diaspora Armenians will also find something to their liking.
“Now is the key moment to pay more attention to Armenian products; citizens and the state should provide maximum support until the crisis is overcome, and we will continue our further work” - Daniel said.
The idea of gathering producers in one site also inspired the Syrian Armenian Vani Nalbandyan, especially since there are prospects for exporting Armenian products abroad in the future.
Vani Nalbandyan - clothing manufacturer
“We came to the conclusion that while we are in Armenia and create Armenian products, the first thing we need is to present it in the National shopping mall” - Vani said.
In case of individual orders, Vani considers it important to choose the right fabric and design; but the prices are affordable so that anyone can buy the Armenian product if they wish.
“We started with the “Nor Arev” garment factory which is under the auspices of the Syrian Armenians.
Now we produce eco-purses, medical gowns, identical national costumes, and we also have an individual production of children's clothing” - the manufacturer noted.
Local products are displayed and sold side-by-side at the National shopping mall where everyone can find anything they need both for themselves and as a unique gift for others.

Monument to Komitas in Paris. How was it created
The Armenian breath in France can be felt everywhere.
Especially in different parts of Paris one can meet a large number of Armenians, see educational centers, shops, restaurants and monuments which tell about the Armenian trace left in France.
One of these historical and cultural monuments is the monument to the great Armenian composer, musicologist Komitas, located on the famous 8th street in Paris.
Back in 1978, the Armenian community of Paris appealed to the city authorities with a request to erect a monument to Komitas and the memory of the victims of the Armenian Genocide.
In 2001, when France recognized the Armenian Genocide, installation work began.
The monument was designed by the famous Armenian architect and artist David Yerevntsi and was unveiled on April 24, 2003 on the bank of the Albert River, next to the Elysee Palace and the French Ministry of Internal Affairs.
In 2009, the adjacent small park was renamed “Yerevan”.
The total height of the monument is 6 meters: the pedestal is 2 meters, the statue is 4 meters; it is made of bronze.
On the reverse side there is a khachkar, there is a book in Vardapet’s hand, and on the other side the head of a child that symbolizes a new life can be seen.
The monument reads: "In memory of Vardapet Komitas and 1.5 million victims of the Armenian Genocide of 1915".
On August 30, 2020, the monument was vandalized.
The phrase “this is a lie” (c'est faux) was left on it. It was immediately removed by the mayor's office of Paris.
Monuments erected in all corners of the world after the Armenian Genocide to never forget this condemnable page in the history “Monument of the Armenian Martyrs”: This is what is written on the plaque of the largest memorial dedicated to the Armenian Genocide in the world.
The memorial in Montebello, California, is the largest of its kind, and Armenians around the world raised $ 125,000 to build it.
Monuments are being erected all over the world after the Genocide.
A monument was erected in the yard of Saint Nazareth Armenian Church in Calcutta, India, on the 50th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.
In the city of Philadelphia, USA, there is a monument dedicated to the Genocide, the sculptor of which is Khoren Ter-Harutyunyan.
The monument symbolizes the bronze image of “Pokr Mher”, the hero of the "David of Sassoun" epos, with a granite pedestal.
On the four sides of the pedestal are carved scenes from the pages of Armenian history: “The Battle of Avarayr”, “The Last Survivors”, “The Defender of Armenian Culture”, “Future”.
A monument to the Armenian Genocide is located in the Armenian Complex near Armenia Street in Nicosia, Cyprus.
The complex includes the building of the Armenian Diocese, Saint Astvatsatsin Cathedral, Nareg Armenian School, the marble khachkar, the bust of Archbishop Zareh Aznavourian and the statue of Grigor Narekatsi.
The monument consists of three magnificent arches, which symbolize Armenia, the Diaspora and the Armenians living in the USSR.
The Genocide khachkar is located in the yard of Saint Virgin Mary Church in Glendale.
It is made of tuff stone brought from Armenia, the base is granite, which consists of 5 parts, symbolizing the 5 continents.
The heart of universal love and charity hanged in the center of the khachkar, from which, as a consequence of the Genocide, blood drips on the cross.
The 12 empty cavities on the khachkar symbolize the 12 Armenian provinces from which the Armenian population was displaced.
The eternity meteor symbolizes the strong and solid future of the Armenian people.
The eagle on the khachkar defines eternal justice.
Every year since the 1915 massacre, Armenians around the world stand up on April 24, each visiting Armenian churches or Genocide memorials in their own country to pay their respects to the memory of the victims.
Museum "Zoravar Andranik" in Varna, Bulgaria
If you ever travel to Bulgaria, choose Varna: it is a beautiful and interesting city for traveling where the house-museum of the Armenian general, statesman, national hero Andranik Ozanyan (Zoravar Andranik) is located.
The great military leader lived for several years in his house in Bulgaria.
This is Andranik Ozanyan’s only house that was preserved through the efforts of the Union of Armenians of Bulgaria.
His houses both in the USA and in Western Armenia no longer exist.
The house in Varna was built by the general in the 1900’s.
In those years, when Andranik came to Bulgaria, as a person of high position and authority he was provided with a plot of land with permission to build a house by the local authorities.
The territory was large, and the commander shared some part of it with others.
The house was bought in 2013 thanks to the efforts of the chairman of the Union of Armenians of Bulgaria, Harutyun Hovsepyan, who also maintained the house at his own expense because otherwise it would have been demolished and an ordinary residential building would have been built on the site.
The house has preserved the furniture which was later restored; the territory was cleaned.
Documents, letters, manuscripts, tools, newspapers, books, medals and the battle saber of the commander that were brought from Bulgaria are now kept in the “Zoravar Andranik” museum in Yerevan.

I have constantly played with many Arab bands in Dubai for 4-5 years.
I have been to Canada, Australia, England, France, the Netherlands, the Arab countries, including Kuwait, Dubai, Qatar, Bahrain, and even played in Africa” added Hovig.
Hovig’s recorded and instrumental music are different, they come from a combination of two different cultures, they sound familiar to the ears of people who prefer both Armenian and Arabian music.
“There is a mixture, even the Arabs like the Armenian shade we gave, as if we brought a new shade here.
I work with many Diasporan-Armenian singers here, I am ready to cooperate with local singers as well, let’s create good music,” Hovig said.
For Hovig, the homeland is the safest and most beloved place.
Here, regardless of work difficulties, life is full of warmth and love.

First, he studied at a private theater school, then continued his education at the Theater University of France: “I studied for 3 years, 60 hours a week during which we danced, sang, learned everything: acting, body flexibility, got acquainted with the works of French writers and studied French."
Sipan always thought about starting a theater group with his French actor friends and coming to Armenia.
In 2018, they came to Armenia with 8 friends.
He introduced the Armenian culture and history to his friends, and together they staged 4 performances for the Armenian audience: “We created 4 stories, the first was the story of Akhtamar, the second was a dance, the third one was a fairy tale that we had written and the fourth was a large puppet theater.
The total duration was 1 hour.
We visited 9 villages and cities: Ashtarak, Karbi, Aparan, Vanadzor, Ijevan, Dilijan, we also visited an orphanage in Gavar and so on to Yerevan which was the last stop.”
Sipan is very enthusiastic about his dream: “I have a dream to preserve the Armenian language in the theater, so that people hear, get surprised, come and ask where I come from, so that they learn about the Armenian people and Armenian culture.”
The positive reviews of the tour prompted the Armenian Diaspora actor to write a new monologue.
Now he is thinking of coming and next time organizing performances in cities and villages of Armenia.

On February 10, the presentation of the new version of the website took place at the Best Western Congress Hotel.
The event was attended by the High Commissioner for Diaspora Affairs Zareh Sinanyan, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the RA National Assembly on Science, Education, Culture, Diaspora, Youth and Sports Mkhitar Hayrapetyan, Deputy Minister of Education, Science, Culture and Sports of the Republic of Armenia Artur Martirosyan, representatives of various organizations, guests from the diaspora.
The head of the department Lucy Vana Karapetyan made an opening speech.
“The platform has been operating since the times of the Ministry of Diaspora and has been very fond of our compatriots from the Diaspora.
Since August last year, when the department was formed, we decided to give "Hayern Aysor" a new breath and content.
This was our team’s dream which has already come true.
Keeping the name and format, we have created a completely new four-language website with new solutions and new faces.
We have also added the Western Armenian language, since we believe that preservation of the language is very important” - the head of the department said, noting the importance of a reliable and trustworthy news platform in the current period of unstable information flow in the diaspora.
MP, former RA Minister of Diaspora Mkhitar Hayrapetyan also considered the relaunch of the news platform in strengthening Armenia-Diaspora relations very important.
“I am happy to say that in the future “Hayern Aysor” will become a unique source of objective information both for the Diaspora and for Armenia, as it was before.
It will also play an important role in strengthening and developing ties between the media in Armenia and Diaspora” - the NA deputy noted.
Zareh Sinanyan, High Commissioner for Diaspora Affairs, was particularly delighted by the addition of the Western Armenian language to Eastern Armenian, Russian and English languages in the website.
“Today, the role of the diaspora and the connection between the diaspora and Armenia are very important.
It must be admitted that there are many circumstances that either destroy or weaken this connection.
And the lack of objective and reliable information is one of the factors that plays a huge role in that.
“Hayern Aysor” has an important mission, since this platform can provide an opportunity to fill the gap, playing an important role in “healing” and strengthening Armenia-Diaspora ties” - he said.
Deputy Minister of Education, Science, Culture and Sports of the Republic of Armenia Artur Martirosyan, in turn, congratulated on the relaunch of the site and noted that the ministry will closely and directly cooperate with the team of "Hayern Aysor".

This is a continuous process, and attracting new resources is important especially in the face of today's challenges” - Artur Martirosyan said.
At the end of the event, the deputy head of the department Vitali Grigoryan presented in detail the updated version of the site with its sections and subsections where materials about Armenia, Artsakh and the life of the diaspora, sights of Armenia, successful and creative people, as well as repatriation and problems can be found.

The Prime Minister expressed hope that an agreement will be reached not only with "Bright Armenia", but also with colleagues from the "Prosperous Armenia" faction.
“If the parliamentary forces nevertheless agree to hold early elections, including arrangements on one or two possible issues, I mean the timing, etc., then the issue can be considered resolved.
After all, from the very beginning, our idea was for this political cycle to end according to the wishes of the people” - Nikol Pashinyan said.
The head of the "Bright Armenia" faction, Edmon Marukyan, stated that he proposed early elections, first of all, proceeding from the created political crisis to which, in his words, the situation with the General Staff affected as well.
“I believe that it is necessary to end the conflict between the army and the government and go to the elections because it is obvious that an agreement cannot be reached on the pre-election process until the issue with the army is resolved” - Marukyan noted.
Nikol Pashinyan considered it unacceptable to link the situation with the General Staff of the Armed Forces with early elections, stressing the Armed Forces should be apolitical according to constitutional norms.

Nikol Pashinyan offers condolences on the passing of Jivan Gasparyan
Acting Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent a condolence cable on the passing of world famous duduk player Jivan Gasparyan. The message reads, in part:
“I was deeply grieved to learn about the demise of world famous duduk player Jivan Gasparyan.
Throughout his career, the renowned Master spread the glory of the Armenian duduk across the globe, performing on many reputable stages, presenting the sounds of Armenian music in films, cooperating with popular composers and internationally acclaimed musicians.
Our nation and the world music community considered Jivan Gasparyan an exceptional Armenian intellectual and ranked him among the Greats of the world art; we were proud and inspired by him.
On listening to Jivan Gasparyan’s music, William Saroyan said: “Dear Jivan, this is not music, but a prayer.”
The prayers created by the Master will forever remain in the hearts and memories of not only Armenians, but also art connoisseurs all over the world.
At the moment of this great loss, I share the grief of his family, colleagues and fans.
Rest in peace, dear Master!”
Nikol Pashinyan referred to the protests of French-Armenians
During a meeting with representatives of the Armenian community at the Armenian Embassy in France, Acting Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, referred to the protest rally organized by the Armenians of France.
“Our dear compatriots were protesting not far from the embassy.
It is their right, but I think it is a way to avoid the issue, I would like it to be clear what the betrayal of our government is.
I pay attention to the accusations against us, I listen to all the arguments,” said Nikol Pashinyan.
Expressing gratitude for the point of views, Nikol Pashinyan mentioned that such discussions are very important.
He referred to the recent war developments, the Karabakh issue.
“The paper with which we stopped the war did not really solve the problems, because the creeping process continues.
It is this realization that did not allow the Karabakh issue to be resolved sooner, which is a very deep, complex knot, the solution of which, in fact, was not possible.
The challenge is not solved, the threat is the same and that is the biggest problem we have,” mentioned Nikol Pashinyan, adding that the years have shown that neither concessions nor flexibility reduced aggression towards Armenia.
The challenge remains the same as managing the aggression that has developed around Armenia.
Nikol Pashinyan touched upon the Armenian-Russian and Armenian-Turkish relations 
On the eve of his working visit to Moscow on April 7, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan gave an interview to the correspondent of “Interfax” in Armenia, touching upon his vision of the future of Armenian-Russian relations, economic ties and prospects for military-technical cooperation.
When asked how much these relations depend on the results of the upcoming snap elections, the Prime Minister said that the Armenian-Russian strategic allied relations are quite rich and are based on the historical friendship between the two peoples.
Therefore, the nature of these relations does not depend on the results of the elections.
Referring to the Armenian-Russian military-technical cooperation, especially the process of acquiring weapons from Russia, Nikol Pashinyan noted that Armenia is focused on broad and long-term cooperation with Russia in this area, which is based on the long-term strategic interests of the two states.
“Armenia is extremely interested in Russian supplies in order to have a modern and compatible power, first of all, with Russia and other CSTO allies.
We are also interested in the fact, the supply of weapons and ammunition to Armenia is carried out in the same configuration as for the Russian Armed Forces,” the Prime Minister said.
As for the issue of getting a new credit for the purchase of weapons from Russia, Nikol Pashinyan noted that such decisions will be made depending on the results of reforms in the army.
When asked whether the restoration of economic ties in the region is due to the political factor, in particular, the settlement of relations with Turkey, Nikol Pashinyan said that Armenia has always supported the normalization of relations with Turkey without preconditions, but Turkey rejected this.
He reminded that the Armenian-Turkish border was unilaterally closed by Turkey in 1993.
“Such a hostile policy of Ankara has gained a new dimension during the 44-day aggression of Azerbaijan against Artsakh.
In particular, Turkey provided direct military-political and military-technical assistance to Azerbaijan, transferring foreign fighters to the Karabakh conflict zone.
In this context, in order to establish a lasting peace and restore the economic picture in the region, Turkey must change this aggressive policy towards Armenia,” Nikol Pashinyan said.

Nikol Pashinyan visited secondary school No. 2 in Gavar and got acquainted with the reconstruction workOn March 9, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan visited the Gegharkunik region.
The Prime Minister, accompanied by Minister of Territorial Administration and Infrastructures Suren Papikyan, Minister of Education, Science, Culture and Sports Vahram Dumanyan, Governor of Gegharkunik region Gnel Sanosyan visited secondary school No. 2 of the regional center of Gavar and got acquainted with the reconstruction work.
The old school building was built back in 1967.
The building was in disrepair, and it was very dangerous to conduct classes there.
Accordingly, it was decided to completely reconstruct the school; the construction was completed at the end of 2020.
The new school building was built as part of the school seismic safety enhancement program implemented by the Armenian Territorial Development Fund of the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Infrastructures.
The investments of the RA government and the Asian Development Bank amounted to 1 billion 380 million drams.
The number of students did not decrease due to the fact that during construction the school did not operate at the main address.
At the moment, the number of students in the school named after Papin Ghandilyan is 422, this number may increase after the new building is put into operation. It is designed for 576 students.
The new building is adapted for people with disabilities, has an elevator, equipped classrooms, a conference hall, a gym, laboratories.
Nikol Pashinyan: “We must clearly demonstrate that consolidation is our first response to crisis situations”
Accompanied by Gegharkunik Marz Governor Gnel Sanosyan, Acting Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan visited Kuth village.
2nd Army Corps Commander, Major General Arayik Harutyunyan reported on the border situation and the actions undertaken by the Armed Forces of the Republic of Armenia.
The Acting Prime Minister met with the residents of Kuth village. He made some important emphases as to what to do in the current situation: “First and foremost, we need to get consolidated in this situation.
Why? Because every time Azerbaijan realizes that it can drive us against each other, it gets more and more enthusiastic trying to do so.
We must make it clear that despite our internal divisions, consolidation will be our first response to their actions.
This is extremely important.
I would like to note that during this period we did not pay due attention to this issue.
And here we are, the families of all our victims, the families of our captive compatriots, all the residents of our border villages, from downtown Yerevan to the provinces, we are all one family, one hearth, and we must be guided by this logic.
There should be no doubts in this regard.
Sobriety is the second imperative. It is obvious that the situation is quite stressful and too sensitive, but we should never lose our sobriety.
Neither must we lose the sense of balance, because if we lose sobriety and poise, we will be prevented from assessing the situation accurately and making the right decisions.
The next important task is to be able to distinguish the truth from fake news in terms of information, not to succumb to speculative tricks, and not to become a victim of information warfare.
I want to say it again, I say it in this community, I say it with a look in all your eyes, let no one even think that the incumbent government is involved in some shady, dark deals, or conspiracies. There can be no such thing at all.
Looking you straight in the eye, I assure you that it is impossible.
The next thing is not to lose your will power.
Living in this village, living in these communities, you are already becoming heroes, it is not for me to tell you - you are heroic people.
We should not lose the strength of our will power; we must clearly defend our state, our sovereignty, our independence, our citizenship.
This is crucial; this is what matters most.
And in this situation we are of course overwhelmed with emotional love for the Motherland, but we should not take emotional steps.
We must clearly analyze what is happening, we must understand what is going on and solve the problem step by step.
What's going on now?
Many people keep asking this question.
The point is that Azerbaijan wants to take away our sovereignty; they want to take away our statehood; they want to deprive us of our Motherland.
Why is the Karabakh issue still not settled?
Let us go back to September 27, 2020, because Azerbaijan used to decline any compromise that Armenia agreed to.
That is, it was said: okay, let us make concessions for the sake of peace.
When Armenia was ready to make these concessions, the very next moment Azerbaijan undermined the process, trying to achieve even more concessions.
I will now dwell on the current situation.
Today’s situation is obvious: Azerbaijan has infringed on the state border of the Republic of Armenia.
There can be no other viewpoints or opinions here.
And there can be no question of a concession, because you understand that if we give up our border, it will, on the contrary, encourage them even more.
We are stating clearly: this is our sovereign territory under international law and all Azerbaijani troops must definitely leave our territory.
And here we must demonstrate our firm resolution.
But on the other hand, we should not let the situation go of control.
And today, first of all, we must advance this agenda by diplomatic means; we must formulate a clear-cut demand on international platforms.
The United States has acknowledged that this is our sovereign territory and the Azerbaijanis need to pull back; France, India and other countries did so.
The European Parliament adopted a resolution stating this fact.
The Russian Federation recognizes that this is our territory.
And we must achieve their withdrawal through consistent, well-balanced, decisive and not nervous steps.
Please do not believe in any conspiracy theories.
We tell you what we intend and what we think.
And we must be consistent.
Today’s incident happened in the following way: we were conducting engineering works on the border, as we always do, when 6 of our servicemen were captured on our territory.
They must be immediately returned to the Republic of Armenia.
This is our clear and unequivocal position.”
Nikol Pashinyan’s trip was concluded with a consultation held with the heads of local communities at the Vardenis City Hall.
Nikol Pashinyan’s Congratulatory Message on Constitution Day
Dear compatriots, Dear people,
Congratulations to all of us on the occasion of July 5 – Constitution Day.
We are celebrating the July 5, 2021 in a completely new environment: we have ensured full compliance with the unchangeable Article 2 of the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia, which provides that the state power in the Republic of Armenia belongs to the people and the people exercise their power through free elections.
The early parliamentary elections of June 20, 2021 showed that following several decades of continued struggle, this constitutional provision is now irreversibly enforced in Armenia.
Every citizen of the Republic of Armenia sees and knows that he is a decisive force, as provided by the Constitution of our country.
Thus, the early parliamentary elections showed that fundamental changes have taken place in our constitutional consciousness over the past three years, and for the first time in the history of the Third Republic, elections became a way to overcome the internal political crisis, and not provoke it.
This creates preconditions for our mission to create a constitutional reality with new impetus.
The essence of our further action is set out in the Preamble and in Article 1 of the Constitution of our country.
We must bring together and mobilize the pan-Armenian potential to build a sovereign, democratic, social and rule of law-based Republic of Armenia, and unification should take place according to the people’s will, and not against it.
Our priorities shall be structured around the agenda of external and constitutional security, around the reform of our state institutions, which should serve these agendas.
The proper implementation of these programs will help us create legal, social, educational and infrastructural conditions to promote human development; we must spare no effort to advance this agenda in order to ensure Armenia’s security, power, freedom, happiness, raise the people’s living standards.
During this period, we will not be able to avoid discussing the reform of our country’s governance system, but even in this important issue we should be guided by the principle of “Score twice before you cut once.”
Dear compatriots, Dear people,
I bow to the memory of our brothers and sisters who gave their lives for the sake of the Motherland, for the sake of our sovereign statehood. I congratulate all of us on Constitution Day.
Nikol Pashiyan’s Message: Maintaining our Independence is Like Maintaining our Health, We Must Take Care of it Every Day 
RA Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has sent a congratulatory message on the occasion of the 32nd anniversary of RA’s declaration of independence.
The message included what follows.
“Dear people, dear compatriots,
Today marks the 32nd anniversary of Armenia’s declaration of independence.
On August 23, 1991, the declaration adopted by the Supreme Council states that the Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia is in the process of becoming an independent state.
This process ended on the 21st of September, 1991, with the national independence referendum and with the public recognition of Armenia as an independent country.
In truth, this process has still not been completed, not because we do not have independence, but because maintaining our independence is like maintaining our health, we must take care of it every day even if we have it.
The government is fighting for the freedom of the Armenian Republic every day.
Independence is like a source of security for us, but the international structures that provide it are cracking in front of our own eyes, and the first painful rupture that we saw was that of Karabakh.
Independence is the result of peaceful relationships with our neighbors. While we maintain excellent relations with some of them, there is no significant progress in our relations with the others and that is because they demand too big of a sacrifice from us, or, as they claim, we demand too much from them.
Independence, for us, is a strong relationship between allies, but allies are not always those who stand by your side. There are also those who are allied against you.
Independence is at hand, and for the sake of our independence and statehood, we must have the will to face ourselves, our history and our worldview.
Independence is a mindset, a state-centric mindset, and its absence harms our sovereignty, security, and future.
Independence is freedom, and in our opinion, people have created an independent state so that they can feel free and secure.
Independence is education, and until every single child living in the remotest village has the same access to education as in our capital, we must grieve for our future.
Independence is a rule of law, a supremacy of rules and rights. Obeying the law and not bypassing it is an advantage.
Independence is work, the kind of work that should create and nurture, not waste and spoil.
Independence is like the Parable of the Ten Virgins, whose wisdom is the following; those who are prepared get awarded, while those who are not get whatever they have taken away from them.
And therefore we will have independence, we will have independence.
I congratulate everyone on this 23rd of August."

One of the streets of the French city of Valence will be named "Stepanakert"
A new district is being built in the French city of Valence, one of the streets of which will be named “Stepanakert”.
According to the Deputy Mayor, this will be the first street named “Stepanakert” not only in France, but also in Europe.
“The first words of our mayor were: "I want to do something that will be remembered."
The new district will have two main streets, one will be called Stepanakert and the other - Toros Street, in honor of the Armenian sculptor Toros Rastkelenyan.
We can say, the Toros-Stepanakert crossroads” - said the Deputy Mayor of Valence George Rastklan in an interview with “Hayern Aysor”.
According to him, Valence decided to become the sister city of Stepanakert.
There will be signs on the new street that present the history of Artsakh.
They will cooperate with the culture department and the Artsakh Ministry of Culture: “The French are very curious, if they see the name "Stepanakert", they will definitely try to find out where it comes from.
It is possible that the statues of "grandfather and grandmother" will be installed there.
George Rastklan noted that by this they were trying to raise the issue of recognizing the independence of Artsakh.
They hope that other countries will also support this idea.

Pargev Samuelyan is the first Armenian host in Turkey to present world news on a weekly basis.
Luys is the first Armenian-language television in Turkey.
It was created and broadcasted with difficulty.
“The Kuran family decided to found “Luys TV”, the first Internet TV in Turkey in Western Armenian.
It should be noted that the Kuran family has been publishing the Luys edition for 8 years, which has Turkish-Armenian sections, respectively, the goal of Luys TV was initially to preserve the Western Armenian language”, - he said.
Pargev made a great contribution to the creation of Luys TV.
It is of great importance for him that they speak Armenian on television.
“When I find out that foreigners admire the Armenian language, want to get acquainted with Armenian literature, culture, history, I feel like a successful person”, - he said.
According to Pargev Samuelyan, the formula for success outside the homeland is to be a purposeful person.
According to him, one needs to be prepared for difficulties.
“It should be understood that  there will definitely be obstacles, there will be ups and downs when performing any work but you should not be upset, you just need to follow the saying measure seven times, cut once - this is the secret of success”, - he said.
Far from the Motherland but keeping the culture. Pargev's desire and goal is to protect the Western Armenian language and the literary heritage left by generations outside the homeland.

Parliament of the Netherlands adopted pro-Armenian resolutions
The Dutch parliament adopted a resolution by Christian Union MP Joel Fordewind demanding from the Dutch government to recognize the Armenian Genocide, as well as a resolution by Martin van Halfert on the need to return Armenian captives from Azerbaijan.
President of the Federation of Armenian Organizations of the Netherlands Mato Hakhverdyan noted: “The resolutions were adopted by an overwhelming majority of votes.
Only 3 deputies from the pro-Turkish faction voted against.
Joel Fordewind demanded from the government to announce how it was going to implement the provisions of the resolution adopted by the majority of votes.
The Federation of Armenian Organizations of the Netherlands (FAON), the April 24 Committee and all Armenians in the Netherlands are grateful to Joel Fordewind and many other members of parliament who have made every effort over the years to recognize the Armenian Genocide.
The message of the resolution of Fordewind and others is that it is necessary to speak about things in an understandable language so that in the future it will be possible to find solutions to sensitive problems."
“FAON believes that this idea is very important, especially during the current situation, since it was during the Nagorno-Karabakh war that Genocide Watch warned of a new genocide, and after the war, both Turkey and Azerbaijan took an aggressive position towards Armenia” - FAON noted, expressing hope that the government will not ignore this statement of the parliament and will fulfill it.
In a new resolution, parliament declares that it can no longer accept the government's current approach.
“During the Armenian Genocide, other Christian minorities such as Assyrians, Arameans, Pontic Greeks also fell victim to mass extermination.
It is also hurtful for them when the Dutch government does not recognize the genocide” - stated the Federation of Armenian Organizations of the Netherlands.

Persons over 27 years of age who have evaded compulsory military service will receive an amnesty
Those who evade mandatory military or alternative service and reach the age of 27 will receive an amnesty.
According to the Minister of Justice, unlike previous trials, this time it will be applied to persons suspected or convicted of committing a crime under part 1 of Article 327 of the Criminal Code.
“The draft law proposes to exempt from punishment persons sentenced to release, in respect of which, the sentence was not conditionally applied,  or the serving of the sentence was postponed, who were sentenced to imprisonment not related to deprivation of liberty.
By declaring an amnesty, to stop the control over the persons released on parole from serving their sentences,” Justice Minister Rustam Badasyan said.
The project mainly concerns those Diaspora Armenians who cannot return to Armenia due to criminal prosecution.
The beneficiaries of the amnesty will also be persons wanted on the basis of this article, who will voluntarily appear before the criminal prosecution authority or the court until December 31, 2021 included.
The Prime Minister stressed that this was the beginning of a process of deep and meaningful reforms in the army.
“We have repeatedly said that, unfortunately, the authority of the army and the authority of service in the army were not comparable to each other in our country.
And unfortunately, we felt this problem of a crack on our skin.
This is an attempt, a political decision, a new stage, the opening of a new page, including the relations with the Diaspora,” the Prime Minister stressed.
The Chief Commissioner of the Diaspora, Zare Sinanyan added that there are many beneficiaries in the Diaspora and it can help to create a healthy atmosphere in the Diaspora.
“During the war, there were many cases when people wanted to fight voluntarily, but could not, because they were wanted,” Sinanyan said.
“Let’s state that we are taking on this political responsibility, and we are making this political decision, not a legal one.
I am sure that this is the right decision because there is no other way out of this cycle,” the Prime Minister said.
In the near future, the future structure of the Armed Forces will be discussed and in this regard, clear decisions should be made.

PM Pashinyan, Mrs. Anna Hakobyan offer condolences on passing of Vartan Gregorian
On behalf of my spouse Anna Hakobyan and on my own behalf, I hereby extend our most profound condolences over the demise of renowned Armenian intellectual Vartan Gregorian.
I offer words of consolation and sympathy to Gregorian’s family, relatives, friends and colleagues.
Vartan Gregorian was one of the most prominent and recognizable members of the Armenian Diaspora over the past few decades.
Having taught at several American universities, Vartan Gregorian subsequently became the president of the world-famous New York Public Library, president of Brown University and ended his career as the renowned Carnegie Corporation’s president.
His spent his years promoting education and science in the United States, strengthening mutual recognition and trust between peoples and cultures, for which he was awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom.
A great patriot, Vartan Gregorian was dedicated the Armenian community in the United States.
It is no coincidence that the Armenian-born intellectual, who left the Iranian city of Tabriz in his early years and studied at Armenian educational institutions in Beirut, entertained strong spiritual ties with his people.
His inherent qualities of a true Armenian intellectual-humanist made him co-found Aurora humanitarian initiative in the last years of his life.
Vartan Gregorian was a unique beacon and a role model for many Armenians both in Armenia and in the Diaspora.
His absence will be a great loss to our nation.
Anna and I have kept fond recollections of our meetings with Vartan Gregorian the extraordinary man.

The Armenian Embassy in the UK posted a statement on its Facebook stating that posters representing Armenian historical and cultural heritage as Azerbaijani have been removed from London metro stations.
Since their inception, both the embassy and a number of public organizations in the country have filed complaints.
It should be reminded that on one of the posters with a mosque and the Armenian Dadivank Azerbaijan was presented as a multicultural center, and on the other poster with the inscription “Shusha, Karabakh - the capital of Azerbaijan's arts” Shushi was depicted.
Power belongs to you, anyone must comply with your decision. PM Visits Aragatsotn Marz.
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan visited Nerkin Bazmaberd, Nor Edesia, Ujan, Byurakan, Karbi and Ohanavan communities in Aragatsotn Marz.
The Premier met with the locals, spoke about the current situation, the details of the Artsakh war and the upcoming programs.
The meetings began with a minute of silence held in memory of those killed during the 44-Day War.
In each community, Prime Minister Pashinyan announced the names of the children killed in those communities, and visited the graves of heroes and their families.
Addressing the locals, the Prime Minister said: “There are aggressive forces in Armenia; aggression is being stepped up day by day.
But I want to state that we avoided civil clashes during this confrontation, which is a great achievement.
I also wish to state that this is first of all the achievement of our people as you did not fuel civil clashes”.
According to the Prime Minister, there are people and forces in Armenia who want blood.
They want blood to be shed on the streets of Yerevan, Aragatsotn because these people do not have enough blood shed on October 27, March 1, dozens of political murders, these people want to involve Armenia in a new bloodshed.
"Why people, because they know very well that the Karabakh issue can be used as a means of payment in the struggle for power?
In 1998, these people came to power over the Karabakh issue, saying that they unequivocally rejected the so-called phased option in resolving the conflict.
But as a matter of fact, they had been negotiating a phased resolution for 20 years. The document negotiated in the process of settling the conflict, or otherwise the phased option of the settlement, which they rejected, was entitled “On the first stage of the settlement of the Karabakh issue and on the steps that should follow.”
“They came to power by declining the phased option, but ended up negotiating a document entitled as mentioned above.
But there is another nuance here: they used to reject that option for 20 years, but continued to negotiate it until 2018.
They also did a trick, as if they had achieved great diplomatic success: they managed to write in one of the headings that it was a package solution” - the Prime Minister said.
Nikol Pashinyan referred to Serzh Sargsyan's statement from the rostrum of the National Assembly in April 2018.
The Prime Minister said that Serzh Sargsyan then said that the negotiation process was suspended because Azerbaijan had unrealistic expectations from the negotiation process which were unacceptable for us.
“This follows up on what I said, namely that in fact, continuing from that point on meant the restoration of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region as part of the Republic of Azerbaijan.
He then added that from that point on we should not hope that Azerbaijan would not try to resolve the Karabakh issue through military means.
There is a video, and anyone can check whatever I say.
And accordingly, if we were to accept the unrealistic, unacceptable conditions set forth by Azerbaijan, what should we do, should we continue the process of returning Karabakh to Azerbaijan?
When the rejected one said that Karabakh would never be part of Azerbaijan, people wondered what he was saying; what he was talking about.
He knew very well where he was leading the negotiation process, while others did not know since the relevant documents were classified, but he knew.
They have been accusing me of handing over land ever since May 2018, when my tenure as Prime Minister just turned a week.
I had not seen the documents; the relevant papers had not even appeared on my desk, but they insisted that I had come to hand over land.
They know very well where they had driven the negotiation process.
And now they want to see bloodshed instead of elections” - the Prime Minister said.
According to the Prime Minister, It is important to talk about the future, about what should be done next.
According to Nikol Pashinyan, we just need to state the realities we are facing today.
“And the reality is as follows: we must live in this region.
But what is the biggest problem of our living in this region?
The point is that we are perceived as enemies, and we perceive others as enemies...
The more we are perceived as enemies, the more we perceive others as enemies.
And it is even difficult to trace back the point from which all this started” - the Prime Minister said.
“Next, we must state that the Karabakh issue has not been resolved.
No matter the Azerbaijani leadership declares that the Karabakh issue has been resolved, the Karabakh issue has not been resolved as of yet.
And I want to say that there will be many questions about why our guys died in the end?
I would rather answer this question in a specific manner. Our guys did not fall for the President of Azerbaijan to declare that the Karabakh issue has already been resolved.
Instead, we can say that the Karabakh issue has not been resolved yet, because Azerbaijan sought to settle the issue by physically exterminating the Armenians in Karabakh.
We all know that, don’t we?
Artsakh survived; there are Armenians in Artsakh, and I wish to state that this would have been impossible without the sacrifice made by our perished brothers, our soldiers and our army.
Yes, we went through a brutal war, but I wish to reaffirm that we owe it to our guys what we have now.
And I want us, yes, to proudly applaud our soldiers and our army” - the Prime Minister said.
Nikol Pashinyan stated that we must move forward.
The opening of regional communications and roads is mutually beneficial.
Unblocking communications is beneficial for both Armenia and Azerbaijan: Azerbaijan will thereby get a communication link with Nakhichevan, Armenia will have a reliable railway and overland communication with the Russian Federation and the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This means that the economy of our country can change significantly.
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan will Leave for the Russian Federation on a Working Visit
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan will leave for the Russian Federation on a working visit from September 6 until September 9.
The PM will participate in the 7th Eastern Economic Forum which is to be held in Vladivostok with the theme "On the Path to a Multipolar World". The Russian president Vladimir Putin and other world leaders will participate in the Forum.
A meeting between the Armenian Prime Minister and the Russian President is also planned.
Prime Minister on early parliamentary elections, amendments to the Constitution and current crisisThe rally on Republic Square began with the anthem of Armenia and a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the Second Artsakh War and March 1.
Nikol Pashinyan began his speech by talking about the problems Armenia is currently facing.
The Prime Minister stressed that the future of the country and the people depends on the solution of these problems.
"The tragic consequences of the second Karabakh war, the fact of our victims and missing people, the fact that many of our brothers and sisters were captured, the continuing propaganda of violence, attempts to involve the armed forces and the judiciary in political processes have set new challenges for us”, - the Prime Minister said.
According to Nikol Pashinyan, we have reached the critical point when we no longer have the right to make a mistake.
For 31 years of independence, all possible theoretical and practical mistakes were made.
“Over the past two years and 10 months, we have also made all possible mistakes.
That is, after the revolution.
I am talking about our government, about me personally.
I want to apologize to all of you, all citizens of the Republic of Armenia, all Armenians of the Diaspora, all citizens of the Republic of Artsakh for all my mistakes", - Pashinyan said.
The prime minister said that the biggest promise should be to keep the achievements.
One of them is the right of the people to form a government.
According to Pashinyan, the current crisis must be resolved by reaffirming the power of the people.
"In the Republic of Armenia, only the people should decide who will have power and who will not.
The essence of our current crisis is as follows: they want to take power from the people, and we gathered in the square to say that we will not allow it.
We will not allow everything that has been achieved through decades of struggle and hardship to be destroyed.
And you, the people, citizens of the Republic of Armenia, will continue to remain the supreme power in the Republic of Armenia, as it was", - the Prime Minister said.
Nikol Pashinyan said from Republic Square that Onik Gasparyan had started the process of collecting signatures on the initiative of Serzh Sargsyan.
Nikol Pashinyan said that the people who brought the army against the people on March 1 are now doing the same.
"When the Chief of the General Staff appointed by me carries out the orders of the “rejected” one, this is the greatest betrayal.
This is the betrayal.
But I repeat once again, dear people, let's reason correctly: the paper for the signatures of the generals was put on the table by Onik Gasparyan.
After the signing, the decision to publish the paper was also made by Onik Gasparyan.
And I repeat once again, Onik Gasparyan must leave, the rest must return to their service", - the Prime Minister said.
Nikol Pashinyan stated that some forces have convinced the military personnel that the government and the authorities want to take them to the court.
According to the Prime Minister, this was done in order to hide several perpetrators behind the backs of many of the army's heroic officers.
"We know who is the hero, we know who is the coward.
And you will not be able to turn our heroes, heroes of the people against the people.
Onik, dear, you made a big mistake.
You did not follow the orders of your commander in chief.
You carried out the order of a man who was rejected by the people, plundered the country, wanted a cut wherever possible.
This is the greatest violation of an officer's honor.
This is the greatest humiliation of an officer's honor", - the Prime Minister said.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that the new Constitution or amendments to the Constitution should be adopted by referendum in October this year, and the transition to a semi-presidential ruling system should be one of the possible options.
According to Nikol Pashinyan, the current Constitution creates many risks.
"Our biggest task should be the creation and formation of such constitutional structures that will guarantee stability and security in the Republic of Armenia, excluding the occurrence of such crises", - the Prime Minister said.
The government is ready to go to early parliamentary elections if other parliamentary forces agree.
Nikol Pashinyan expressed confidence that the people are able to establish a legitimate government in Armenia.
"I give a second chance, I throw down a challenge: let's go to the elections, let's see, whose resignation the people are demanding, let's see what the people demand.
And when they say that we weren’t serious when proposed parliamentary elections, I would like to reveal to you a little secret: at that time we even thought about variants of the slogan, and we had a version of running in early parliamentary elections with the slogan "End to Velvet"", - Nikol Pashinyan said.
The rally led by Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan ended with a march in memory of the victims of March 1.
The Prime Minister, together with the participants of the march, laid flowers at the monument to Al. Myasnikyan, and paid tribute to the memory of the victims.
Prime Minister Pashinyan met with President Sargsyan
The Prime Minister and the President discussed the current situation in the country, ways of solving problems and overcoming the internal political crisis.
In this context, the holding of early parliamentary elections was discussed as well.

Private houses will be built in Alaverdi for two soldiers who took part in the 44-day Artsakh warKaren, who took part in the 44-day Artsakh war, will soon have his own house.
Karen lost both hands during the war.
After receiving rehabilitation treatment at the soldier's house, he has already returned home, back to Alaverdi.
Now he is waiting for the prosthesis.
The war, as he says, has changed him, he is not constrained by problems or difficulties anymore.
“When you overcome, you already know that it is nothing, you continue to live, you put those problems aside,” says Karen.
Karen is a sculptor by profession, he studied at the college for 3 years.
I called the master and said that I would come to sculpture.
After seeing Karen’s house for the first time, National Assembly deputy, Aren Mkrtchyan, decided to turn to different people, ask for help, to build a new house for the boy.
“We saw the need for Karen, who was ready to sacrifice his life for the sake of the country, to have his roof over his head,” said Aren Mkrtchyan.
According to Aren Mkrtchyan, two houses will be built in Alaverdi. Օne for Karen, the other for another soldier who had returned from captivity.
About 75-80 square meters are private houses with an area of 1.500 square meters. They are technologically equipped, there will be a thermal insulation system, and there will be a central heating system,” said Aren Mkrtchyan.
Karen and his sister Herminé are now settling paperwork, as the house where they now live is not privatized.
The sister is looking forward to the day when Karen will have a prosthesis and will have her own house:  
We must make sure that Karen always feels good, it does not matter that the situation is like this now.
His life is still ahead, he is young, the important thing is that we are by his side, we will never leave him alone and everything will be fine for sure.
The construction of both houses and the planning was made by the head of the Armenian community of Hamburg, Serzh Angelyan.
As soon as he heard the request for help, he responded positively:
“I had no doubt that this work had to be done, we saw the need, we started it very soon.
A very nice apartment was built, first, we decided to build an apartment, and then we decided to build a house.
Our soldier had a territory, thank God, and was living under very difficult social conditions, in a cottage that does not fit us, does not fit the Armenians, so that the soldier who went for war, fought, wounded, and then came back, lives in the cottage,” Said the head of the Hamburg community.
They decided to continue the construction of such houses in the future.
In the future, the problems of furniture and household appliances will be solved.
By the end of the summer, the private houses will be handed over to the boys.
Producer Jivan Avetisyan will present a film about the 44-day Artsakh war to the public
Producer Jivan Avetisyan, known for his films about Artsakh (“Tevanik”, “The last Inhabitant”, “Gates of Paradise”), will soon present a new feature film to the public.
“The Reborn” will tell about the 44-day Artsakh war in 2020.
It was initially decided to make a film about the April 2016 war, but the events of last year changed the plans.
“It has always been important for us to create a high-quality work of art, the film is not an end in itself, but a good deed, through which we tried to tell about Artsakh.
The film had a rapid development process,” the producer said.
To implement the idea of the film, the creative team has launched a co-funded campaign, which you can join via kickstarter.com.
“If one time we tried to tell the world about us with films about Artsakh, now it is also important to tell our next generation, children,” he stressed.
The scriptwriter is Narine Voskanyan.
According to her, the theme is primarily peace, but to achieve this peace, it is necessary to find the identity of the nation.
“These human-made disasters were precisely due to the loss of identity, and we need a revival, and that revival will be from Artsakh,” the scriptwriter noted.
The actors of the film are still unknown, but both Armenian and foreign actors will be involved.

Putin to have a Phone Conversation with Pashinyan
President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, is to have a phone conversation with PM Nikol Pahinyan on August 29.
This was stated by the press spokesman of the Russian President, Dmitri Peskov.
"Today is a very important day for Russia and Armenia.
25 years ago, the two countries signed on the Friendship Treaty, and on this occasion, President Putin will have a phone conversation with Pashinyan later today." Said Peskov.
He also stated that the parties will emphasize the importance of the treaty to maintain a bilateral alliace, and that this will be a good oppertunity to discuss current issues as well.
Q&A session between the National Assembly and the government. What was discussed in parliament
The deputy of the "Bright Armenia" faction Arkady Khachatryan during the meeting of the National Assembly and the government in the Q/A format appealed to the Prime Minister for clarifications on the well-known statement about "Iskander". In particular, the deputy asked why the information about the use of “Iskander” had not been verified.
To this question, Deputy Prime Minister Tigran Avinyan replied that possible clarifications on this issue had already been made, and the Russian side told that there were no problems.
Deputy of the ruling faction Nazeli Baghdasaryan inquired from the Minister of Foreign Affairs what are the explanations for a number of problematic statements of the President of Azerbaijan about the captives.
“The politicization of this important humanitarian issue which is confirmed by various representatives of the international community is unacceptable. The international pressure on Azerbaijan has already been increased. Yesterday, the Italian parliament also adopted a resolution calling on Azerbaijan to immediately resolve this issue” - the Foreign Minister said.
Taking into account that the Red Cross and the ECHR have an approved list of the captives, the minister clarified what efforts are being made to return them.
“Direct contacts on this issue are being established through Russian President Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.
The Russian side consistently reminds the leadership of Azerbaijan about this issue” - the Minister said, adding that this issue was also discussed at the level of the Minsk Group co-chairs, and noting that it is obvious that this issue was becoming really problematic for Azerbaijan.
The head of the “Bright Armenia” faction, Edmon Marukyan, asked the Prime Minister to publicly clarify the statement that the head of the General Staff Onik Gasparyan had demanded the resignation of the government and the Prime Minister by order of the third President of the Republic of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan.
“I don’t think there is a need for additional clarification regarding the Prime Minister’s statement. The Prime Minister made such statements as he saw fit. If the need arises, we will additionally return to this statement” - Deputy Prime Minister Tigran Avinyan replied, noting that other statements made on March 1 should be taken into account.
Marukyan added that after such a statement, there is public demand for evidence.
In response, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Prime Minister's statement did not remain unanswered: some RPA representatives made statements in this regard which the Deputy Prime Minister offered to familiarize with, and added that, if necessary, the Prime Minister will provide details in the future.
At the NA meeting Ani Samsonyan, deputy of the “Bright Armenia” faction, re-read the statement of the General Staff of February 25, stressing that she believed that the General Staff had not taken that decision in one day and had had a noteworthy reason to demand the resignation of the RA Prime Minister; she inquired where the line was crossed.
“The statement of the General Staff raises many questions, since the military, especially the head of the General Staff, the leadership, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 14 of the RA Constitution, should not have anything to do with politics or be associated with it.
Questions arise, since the main task of the General Staff is to protect our borders, ensure the safety, and political statements are not part of the functions of the General Staff” - the Deputy Prime Minister said in response.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that politicians were different from the military, and that difference should be constant, because otherwise the foundations of the RA statehood would be undermined.
Avinyan expressed hope that the Armed Forces would carry out exclusively those functions with which they had been authorized in accordance with the laws and the RA Constitution.
During the meeting, Mkhitar Hayrapetyan, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Science, Education, Culture, Diaspora, Youth and Sports of the National Assembly of the Republic of Armenia, presented the previous discussions on the science financing and suggested Deputy Prime Minister Tigran Avinyan to explain the government's approach to the scientific community and tell what was the reason that there would be no certain threshold for GDP or budget expenditures.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that they were definitely ready to significantly increase the budget for funding science.
He noted that the experience of 2020 showed that the additional funds were spent effectively, and that they were waiting for proposals from the State Committee of Sciences.
When is RA Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan planning early parliamentary elections and constitutional amendments for the transition to semi-presidential or presidential rule?
Answering the question of the independent deputy of the National Assembly Arman Babajanyan, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan once again explained that the early parliamentary elections would be held exclusively with the consent of the parliamentary opposition colleagues.
“The question is that we want to do everything by agreement because we do not want to take steps that will later be considered in the context of “contrary to”.
We see elections as a way to restore public solidarity.
And elections are a tool for solving this problem; we want our dear compatriots to have the opportunity to speak out, so that regardless of whether they support the government or the opposition, they have the opportunity to go to the polls and express their will” - the Prime Minister said.
Nikol Pashinyan also stressed that the Government and political forces should act as a guarantor for these elections to be held in free, fair and legal conditions.
The Prime Minister plans to meet with the leaders of the parliamentary opposition in the coming days.
He expressed hope that an agreement would be reached.
Member of the "Bright Armenia" faction Karen Simonyan asked the Minister of Transport and Communications Hakob Arshakyan why the ministry had had problems with logistics during the military-technical exhibition in the UAE, and what were the results of the official investigation.
“The exhibits that did not arrive due to logistical problems are just a part of what gives the look during the military industrial exhibition.
Opinions were voiced that the exhibition pavilion was empty, I think that such statements should be avoided because, in fact, the content of the exhibition participation is provided both by companies with their experience and by specialists who are looking for new markets” - Hakob Arshakyan said, adding that they would make sure that the deputies learn about the results of the official investigation.
He also stressed that the organizational work began quite late due to the war and the coronavirus, and that could be considered one of the reasons.

“We are in touch with French President Emmanuel Macron.
We should work to properly hold the Armenian Genocide commemoration events.
We take actions so that the event will be attended by the government representatives, the Paris Mayor, the representatives of the regions, MPs.
Of course, we will keep all the coronavirus-related rules.
By respecting the laws we must organize the demanding events of April 24th.
We couldn’t stay silent on April 24, 2021”, he said.
According to him, what has taken place against Armenians in Artsakh in 2020 is unacceptable, and the events organized by the French-Armenian community will also focus on this.
He says Turkey’s participation to the recent war unleashed by Azerbaijan against Artsakh, Turkey’s expansionist policy should be voiced so that the international community will condemn President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s actions.
“Azerbaijan recorded success in the war because Turkey was standing by it not only with specialists, equipment, but also with jihadists.
We should continue to raise, criticize this in order for the international community to condemn Turkey’s actions.
We should continue our fight for our fallen heroes.
We should work for the restoration of Artsakh.
This is important, Artsakh must re-find its Armenian borders”, he said.
An Armenian Genocide commemoration event will be held in Paris on April 24 near the statue of Komitas.
Various rallies are expected to take place in different cities, including outside Turkey’s diplomatic representations.

Repatriate designer Sipan Kdmiryan started his studio in ArmeniaSeveral straight lines, then circular. This is the first, preparatory stage of the work of the interior designer Sipan Kdmiryan.
Then the hardest part comes. All this needs to be adapted to customer requirements.
“There are more difficulties with builders than with customers.
Customers can be convinced in the necessity of the proposed stylistic solution.
There are certain difficulties, since people here are just learning about the specialization of an interior designer, there is often a misconception that an interior designer creates a 3D image but, in fact, he is not" - Sipan Kdmiryan said.
In fact, according to Sipan, if you entrusted a specialist with your apartment, your area, then you must trust his taste as well.
According to Sipan Kdmiryan, it is the interior designer who has an idea of all the trends.
“Each interior designer has his own signature, his own style.
I like modern and classical styles, I study to understand them better, I also try to add Armenian patterns.” - Sipan Kdmiryan said.
Armenian patterns are very well combined with the trendy colors of the year.
And he tries to direct clients so that the work looks both beautiful and "Armenian".
“There are not many changes in color trends in 2020-21.
Navy Blue is  fashionable - a “novelty of black", it is a fashionable black color, in 2013-2014 the combination of white and black was fashionable, now Navy Blue is trendy.
In 2021, I think light and dark shades of gray will be used the most” - Sipan Kdmiryan said.
Sipan returned to Armenia from Syria.
After studying for several years at the homeland he started his own studio.
The team is small but in case of large-scale orders, he plans to increase the number of employees.
Repatriated potter intends to start a factory in AshtarakHe chose the profession of a political scientist but became a potter.
The Palean family settled in Jerusalem 100 years ago, they are famous potters.
Two years ago, Sedrak decided to return to his homeland and develop the family business here as well.
“It is a great responsibility to continue my family's business which we have been doing for 100 years.
We are already the fourth generation involved in this business.
This is important not only for our family, but also for the history of arts and crafts in Jerusalem.
To this day, the legacy of the Armenian ceramic art of these three families is the symbol of Jerusalem.
Here, the symbol of the greatest art and craft is Armenian porcelain” - Sedrak Palian said.
Sedrak's goal is to create new jobs in Armenia, to support the economic development of the Motherland.
“Our goal is to produce everything in Armenia from the beginning until the end using local resources and materials.
We want to start a factory in Ashtarak, not in Yerevan because everyone comes and starts their business in Yerevan and we want to make sure that everyone knows that there are other villages and cities that need to be developed and jobs should be created there” - Sedrak Palian said.
The young master loves and considers every corner of Armenia to be his own.
Love for the homeland pushed him to leave the family business in Jerusalem and come to Armenia to create his own.
Rock and Persian carpets. Andre Simonyan will present himself to his audience in a new lightAndre Simonyan knows how a CD can be interactive.
The singer who has been living in England for a year will present a new program to his fans after a pause.
This is after he and The Beautified Project took a long hiatus.
“I have never heard anyone do anything like that, but I will not tell much about how it is going to be interactive.
I will release it in 2021.
And after that I intend to work on The Beautified Project, because this year I managed to write the darkest and most interesting melodic album of The Beautified Project " - Andre Simonyan said.
Andre Simonyan is not only a singer, but also a producer.
In recent years, he managed to record duet albums.
The pandemic and war created problems in the music as well.
“It was a very difficult year, I was lucky to be from the rock industry, I never relied on my music financially, because in Armenia it was considered to be “basement” art.
To put it bluntly, you can't earn much on rock music in Armenia, so I also had a job” - Andre said.
The singer launched a startup project that has nothing to do with music.
Interest in carpets which was a hobby turned into a business.
“With one of my friends, I have a startup project that is related to Persian carpets and their processing. This is both a hobby and a business, because my grandmother liked Persian, Karabakh and Armenian carpets, and that love passed on to me."
Andre Simonyan hopes that their group will soon return to the stage.
A restart has been given.

Sale of bracelets and piano lessons․ Diaspora Armenians have found other ways to raise moneyToday the Armenians of the Diaspora are trying to support Armenia and Artsakh in various ways: by organizing demonstrations, fundraising, car rallies, humanitarian aid.
Hasmik Gziryan who lives in Oldenburg, Germany, told “Hayern Aysor” that as soon as she heard the news about the war, she decided to support her homeland by making and selling bracelets.
The money will be transferred to the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund.
“We puzzled over what to do, how to help and an idea was born.
I made 20 bracelets and thought that even if I sell 20 pieces for 2 euros, I will already have 40 euros and, who knows, maybe a little more.
And I just couldn't believe when I already had 60 orders and I rushed to continue as I realized that these 20 bracelets were definitely not enough”,- she said.
People not only from Germany, but also from other countries bought them.
Bracelets are packed and delivered to the addressee by mail.
Hasmik already has over 500 orders.
In Hasmik Tadevosyan’s apartment who lives in another German city, Hannover, the sounds of the piano can be heard all the time.
The goal is to give piano lessons and send all the money from the lessons to the All-Armenian Fund within a year.
“I know that many people from both the Diaspora and Armenia send money but I would very much like it to be done not once, not twice, but repeatedly.
I have a student who I will start the classes with on November 5th.
Some people from Hanover want to have classes online, let's see how it goes, I hope my idea works out”,- she said in an interview with “Hayern Aysor”.
Armenian women living in Germany are already thinking about new ideas to help Armenia and Artsakh hoping that there will soon be peace.
Search Operations in "Surmalu" have Stopped. The Body or Remains of the Missing Citizen have not Been Found
The bodies or remains of the citizens who were labeled missing persons as a result of the search and rescue operations taking place in the "Surmalu" explosion site have not been recovered.
This was reported by the spokesperson for the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication, Hayk Kostanyan, who stated that a decision was made to stop the search operations.
The following was posted on Kostanyan's official Facebook Account: "As you are aware, in the last few days, the search for the citizen who was considered missing as a result of the "Surmalu" explosion was carried out, at the possible location of the blast where the citizen was presumed to be.
In the epicenter of the explosion and in the entire nearby area, thorough search operations were carried out, even twice in some areas.
As a result of the search, unfortunately, the citizen's body or his remains were not found.
I would like to mention that within 43 hours after the fire and explosion, the rescue workers brought out 26 citizens, including 10 alive and 16 dead, from the rubble.
Thus, a decision was made to stop the search."
Serj Avedikian about his films, Armenia and the DiasporaCinematography always brings the French-Armenian film director to Armenia.
Serj Avedikian says sincerely: One of his dreams is for his works to become universal and travel to reach the audience.
It is here that the film director emphasizes that his works are not only for the Armenian or French audience, rather they are for everyone.
“I think I have never created anything just for the Armenian audience.
That would be wrong on my part.
First of all, I work more in France than in Armenia.
It is important for me that what is inherited, and what comes from the internal world, reaches other audiences in a universal way,” said Serj Avedikian.
Those well acquainted with the art of the French-Armenian film director will notice that there is one common line in his films.
Serj Avedikian seasoned each work with poetry.
“One of the second lines is stylization. I do not like very real cinema, there must be an approach to stylized time, because one of the secrets of cinema, animation is its relationship to rhythm, tempo and time,” he said.
To avoid falling behind the tempo and time, Serj Avedikian offers to get out of emotionality.
He says this relates to all spheres.
The Armenian people must understand that the problems and worries are not only theirs, they belong to everyone, all the nations have gone through and are going through difficulties.
“I think that right now that emotionality is coming back, that our people have always established their identity on the broken. It is not necessary not to know or not to do it, rather it is necessary to establish on it, and then go through it, it must be digested, otherwise, we will always remain in that sad-emotional process,” said the French-Armenian film director.
The past, the lessons learned can be re-evaluated, perceived and analyzed through art.
Serj Avedikian notes that the young representatives of the Armenian film industry are making new experiments in the field.
“I notice that young people tend to preserve poetry in cinema, there is a tendency to have a connection with symbolism, which cannot be expressed simply in a direct way, you have to find gestures to express what you cannot say simply in a direct way,” said Avedikian.
At the same time, there is a lack of life in Armenian cinema.
According to the French-Armenian film director, little is said about emotional, simple issues in Armenia through cinema.
“It seems that there are taboos, there are plots that I do not see in the cinema, man and woman, family, street, social position, distrust, internal tragedy, I see little of it, you think that something should be expressed, you should always like this, so stretched, very strong, and to introduce a little simplicity does not mean to be simple, it is difficult to be simple in art.
Serj Avedikian brings the example of Armenia and the Diaspora.
He says that the Diaspora has its own culture, which is different from the culture of Armenians living in Armenia.
They have experienced other migrations, other pains that are similar but different.
Then they became citizens of France, Italy, US, etc.
It means that they are integrated into another language, but have their own identity.
Both the questions and the problems are put on the table in different ways.
According to Avedikian, the Diasporan-Armenian live on someone else’s land, but he has his inner Armenia, which is his own, but for some time it is emotionality.
The French-Armenian film director emphasizes that art, in his case cinema, can connect Armenia and the Diaspora in this way
Serj Tankian about the war, Diaspora and 2 new songs of SOAD
About Artsakh war through rock music. The soloist of the "System of a Down" rock group, musician Serj Tankian believes that the world should know what happened in Artsakh.
To do this, they presented to millions of their fans two new songs about Artsakh after a 15-year break:
“Daron, our guitarist, had already written a song in honor of our soldiers called“ Protect our lands ”.
He said, "Let's work on this song together." We went to the studio together, worked and finished the song.
We wrote another one about terrorists.
All proceeds of the group will be sent to the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund”.
Speaking about the war, Tankian said that there is no civilized enemy in front of the Armenian people and that it is necessaryto be careful and show the world that this is the same Turkish regime that tried to exterminate the Armenians 105 years ago.
According to him, this is a very important issue.
Tankian is sure that it is necessary for the Armenians to unite and raise their voice of protest.
He believes that the Diaspora Armenians should continue doing their best to preserve the nation.
“All my friends and I spread the articles, posts, ideas, hashtags so that everyone on social networks takes these problems as seriously as possible.
This is the problem of the whole world and not only of Armenians: terrorism, ecological catastrophe, human rights violations, all these are global problems”,- Tankian said.
The world famous rock musician also said that they took part in online concerts in order to be able to raise money for the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund.
The group also has plans to visit Armenia.
Tankian assured that they will definitely come in the near future.
Serj Tankian on the internal political life of Armenia
World-famous rock musician, frontman of System of a Down Serj Tankian gave an interview to Vulture.
The Armenian musician spoke about the latest songs, reunion of the rock band after a long break, his political views and Armenia.
As an activist, Tankian has worked to bring awareness of Armenia’s painful history.
To the journalist's question-observation about the election fraud and parliamentary shootings in post-Soviet Armenia, the feeling that America could easily, and may already, be heading down the same path and whether he was worried to see the unrest in his homeland Tankian replied that it was a tragedy.
“Right after Armenia lost the war in Artsakh, and there was a horrible ceasefire that was signed - and I say “horrible” because it’s good that the war has stopped and people stopped dying, but the points of the ceasefire were very damaging to the Armenian nation - there was a ransacking of Parliament in Armenia that same day.
It made me feel that what’s going on in the world is very symptomatic and connected.
I would say that a lot of people are being taken for a ride by forces that are very, very selfish in trying to grab power, and that is the same in this country as it is in Armenia and elsewhere in the world” - Tankian said.
In the interview, they also discussed the tense internal political situation in Armenia in recent weeks, in particular, the demand for the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan by the military leadership.
Tankian said that since the November 10 ceasefire, Armenians had been grieving, not just for the young men that had died, but also for the 2,500-year-old historical homelands that Armenians had lost to dictatorships who attacked with impunity and used disinformation along with high-grade weaponry.
The Armenian musician also noted that the unpleasant internal political situation in Armenia also caused grief and anger toward the current government of Nikol Pashinyan; people are angry because the majority of Armenians are in a state where they don’t know who to support.
“Among the opposition, demanding the resignation of the government, there are forces that are not even in parliament and are connected with the former authorities.
Many are unhappy with what has happened in the current government.
There are issues of mismanagement of the war that are being raised, and other things.
But people also don’t trust the former oligarchic regimes that have stolen from the population and created depopulation within the country for 20 or so years.
The only way forward has to be a democratic one.
The army should not take over.
Opposition shouldn’t just take over.
No one should just take over.
There should be elections.
And they should be sooner than the two and a half years left on the mandate of the current Parliament” - he concluded.

Shops are being built on the territory of the Armenian cemetery in Turkey
Shops are being built on the territory of the Armenian cemetery in the Ulus region of Turkey.
During construction, human bones were discovered.
The Department of the Turkish Chamber of Architects called the continuation of construction a barbaric act and a violation of human rights.
“Scientific sources say that there was an Armenian and Catholic cemetery in the construction site adding that human bones were found during excavation which were examined by the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations.
Despite all this, construction continues in the site which is an insult to multiculturalism in Anatolian lands.
This is barbarism, a violation of human rights” - the statement said.
In his Parliamentary question addressed to Minister of Environment and Urbanization Murat Kurum Karo Paylan has said that even though human bones were found in the site, construction work was not stopped.
The minister has not yet answered Paylan's question.
Karo Paylan tried to familiarize himself with the construction work on the spot but was barred from inspecting the construction site.
“This place was a cemetery for Armenians.
The Armenians living on these lands were deported from here.
They insulted the living, they insulted the dead.
The Armenians who lived here and had laid the gravestones left their relatives to rest here with prayers.
And now their graves are filled with concrete.
What kind of conscience can allow such a thing?" - Garo Paylan said.
The Armenian MP stated that illegal construction is underway there, as there are no relevant permits.

We are cooperating with hospitals, Ministries of Health, Defense, Labor and Social Affairs, verifying data and contacting soldiers.
In February, I think, we will already start the stage of prosthetics” - the MP said.
With the first investments the initiative was supported by the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund and the world-famous musician Serj Tankian.
“This is initially about $1 million and, according to my information, a certain amount has already been raised” - said the executive director of the foundation Haykak Arshamyan.
According to him, prostheses are very expensive: the price of one prosthesis is 20-30 thousand dollars.
The prostheses will initially be brought here, then processed and adapted to the problems of the person.
To make the process shorter and attract more beneficiaries, the foundation plans to start producing prostheses in Armenia.
They have an agreement on the creation of such a laboratory with the “Center for the Defender of the Motherland”, as well as with the “Ortes” Center.

The Armenian communities in Russia have problems with learning the Armenian language.
Zareh SinanyanDuring the meeting with the High Commissioner for Diaspora Affairs, representatives of the Armenian communities in Russia complained about the problems with learning the Armenian language in the communities.
Zareh Sinanyan was suggested to change the format of the books.
“The new generation does not speak Armenian, or at least does not speak Armenian as the first language.
Therefore, communities in Russia need books that can be used to teach the Armenian  language to the children who do not speak Armenian.
And this is a completely different task”- Zareh Sinanyan said.
Zareh Sinanyan believes that books should be made with a scientific approach.
Books with new content are needed for those who speak a foreign language but study Armenian.
According to the Commissioner, people study with old books in the communities he visited.
“They either have old books or ones that they have brought with them personally.
But this is not a systematic approach.
It was not like this before.
We cannot rely on the people to come and take their books with them paying for extra baggage”- Zareh Sinanyan said.
In Moscow, Saratov, Yekaterinburg and Tyumen, the High Commissioner for Diaspora Affairs was informed about problems in the communities when sending humanitarian aid.
Zareh Sinanyan believes that in order to solve these problems, it is necessary to strengthen ties with the diaspora.
“Application of the value added tax to individuals from certain humanitarian organizations is a strange practice for me.
We are talking about those people who sent humanitarian aid during the war.
I was dealing with this issue before I left, I will continue dealing with it in the future as well”- Zareh Sinanyan said.
According to Zareh Sinanyan, in order to involve the diaspora in the economic, social and educational spheres of Armenia, it is necessary to remove constitutional and legislative obstacles in Armenia.
In his words, this will allow Armenia to use the potential of the diaspora.
“People and their capabilities must be used correctly for the benefit of the state.
At the moment, there are a number of constitutional and legislative obstacles”- Zareh Sinanyan said.
During his visit to the regions of Russia Zareh Sinanyan had the aim to get acquainted with the community problems.
In the near future, the Commissioner is also going to visit France and the east coast of America.
The Armenian community in Switzerland expresses support for ArtsakhThe Armenian community in Switzerland also supports Armenia and Artsakh.
Secretary General of the Switzerland-Armenia Friendship Group Sargis Shahinyan assured that they will apply their knowledge and experience to the work with political circles in order to be useful to the Motherland.
“The political message to Switzerland is important but this message is even more important to us, thus, the Armenians can find support through these demonstrations which is a priority for us”,- he said in an interview with “Hayern Aysor”.
According to Sargis Shahinyan, the position of the friendship group turned out to be important, support was received from both the Swiss and Armenian press and also found a response in Turkish political circles.
“It was during these last two days that consciousness awakened and intensified.
We need to force people to act and make them understand that every penny in the wallet of Socar gas stations will be used by Azerbaijan to buy weapons of mass destruction”, - Sargis Shahinyan noted.
He once again called on the compatriots of the diaspora to participate in fundraising, since at this stage this is a priority.
The Armenian community in the United States expects Biden to formally recognize the Armenian GenocideIn 2019, the US House of Representatives and Senate thus adopted the resolutions recognizing the Armenian Genocide.
Taking this into account, Armen Sahakyan, the Executive Director of the Armenian National Committee of Western America, says that now they have high expectations that President Joe Biden will also officially recognize the Armenian Genocide.
“In the case of President Biden’s recognition of the Genocide, this is not the end of our struggle, but the beginning of new work, that is, the recognition opens new doors for us, where the term “Armenian Genocide” can be used without hesitation by the US State Department and diplomatic missions. With this, we have to work in other instances, with other states.
Our ultimate goal, of course, is to put so much pressure on the Turkish government that it will finally face its bitter past, its pages of history, recognize the reality of the Armenian Genocide,” Armen Sahakyan told “Hayern Aysor” during an interview.
Garo Ghazarian, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Armenian Bar Association in Glendale, thinks that the American recognition of the Genocide may open a new page in the legal field, which will make Turkey accountable.
“When the White House accepts, the tunnel will be opened for all the trials that will be allowed to be presented to the court for compensation or for various verdicts, as the issue of the Genocide will no longer be a subject of doubt or bargaining,” Garo Ghazarian emphasized.
In recent years, in parallel with Turkish lobbying or community activities in America, the Armenian community has been trying to achieve the recognition of the Genocide.
Chairman of the Pan-Armenian Council of Western America, Vicken Hovsepian, notes that a number of demands were presented to the White House.
And now they have started collecting signatures online, calling on President Biden to recognize the Armenian Genocide in his April 24 message.
“In that sense, there is some work with different congressmen, about 38 senators of the Senate sent a letter to the president, demanding that he definitely use the word “Genocide” on April 24.
Naturally, all our community events this year should be organized against that background, expecting the president to use that idea to create a legal way for our next work.”
In the previous years, Joe Biden supported the adoption of resolutions recognizing the Armenian Genocide.
Before being elected president, he called the massacre of Armenians a “genocide”.
Many US politicians, representatives of various Armenian organizations, claim that now is the time for Biden to repeat the same thing, only now as president.

Every week we send a message to the community so that they keep sending money as much as they can and keep giving from their weekly and monthly income”,- said Roxana Makasjian in an interview with “Hayern Aysor” also noting that she considers the success in working with the local press to be remarkable.
According to her, the Armenian community of the San Francisco Bay Area will do everything possible to help in this struggle and protect Armenia and Artsakh.

We want Armenia and Artsakh to know that we are on their side, we will protect them”,- she said.
Several small demonstrations in San Francisco were followed by a large-scale march.
Vana Antonyan, Armenian Youth Federation AYF San Francisco “Rosdom” Chapter Member, who was one of the organizers of the demonstration noted that the famous "Golden Gate" bridge in San Francisco had been specially selected as the venue for the demonstration.
“We expected 1000 people but that day 4-5 thousand people came out for the demonstration.

The Armenian Diocese of Great Britain organized a charity concert to support the people of ArtsakhIn January, the Armenian Diocese of Great Britain organized an online charity concert to support the children of Artsakh.
Primate of the Armenian Diocese of Great Britain and Ireland, Hovakim Bishop Manukyan, spoke about the fundraising and the concert in an interview with "Hayern Aysor":
“One of our team members, Andrei Simonyan, who is our artistic director, contacted the Armenian singers and we organized a documentary concert program.
One or two more exhibitions are to be held, after which we must transfer the amount to the program of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin."
Thanks to the fundraising, the Social Security Department of the Mother See was able to provide the people of Artsakh with everything they needed during the winter.
Hovakim Bishop Manukyan also noted that fundraising for Armenia is always held in Great Britain. The proceeds  are transferred to the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund and to the 1000+1 Military Insurance Foundation.
“Online fundraising and events will continue. Regardless of the development of events and the mood of people; we must be next to our people” - said Hovakim Bishop Manukyan.
The next online concert will again be via Zoom video.
All proceeds will be transferred to the people of Artsakh.
The Armenian Genocide events in Turkey will be held with restrictions
The Armenian Genocide events in Turkey will be held with restrictions. The reason is the coronavirus epidemic.
“During the last almost 10 years, we have been used to commemorate April 24 with mass events in the streets and squares.
Last year and this year, there may be no public events due to the epidemic,” said Pakrat Estukyan.
There will be online discussions instead.
Intellectuals interested in the Genocide will talk about the massacres of Armenians through online press conferences.
The initiators are Turks, who are interested in the dark pages of their history.
“There is a stream of new historians who have been educated in the West, in the United States and Europe, and with their researches, they have brought a completely new tone and breath to the study of the Genocide issue,” said the editor of Agos newspaper.
The editor of Agos newspaper emphasizes that Turks participated more actively in public events, in Turkey, in recent years.
According to Esdugian, this is a means of self-criticism, by which the Turks try to face the tragic episodes of their history.
“The nationalists are also protesting, denying the Genocide, but the police are blocking them, so there is no danger,” Esdugian said.
According to Pakrad Esdugian, every year these events are moved from the central squares of Ankara and Istanbul to the suburbs.
In this way, the authorities are trying to divert the public’s attention from such topics.

The Armenian National Committee launched an information campaign to prevent anti-Armenian actions in San Francisco
Anti-Armenian actions in San Francisco began in July when threatening graffiti appeared on the walls of an Armenian school.
The search for those who did it continues.
“The first attack was made on our Groozean-Zakaryan-Vaspurakan school.

There was a more dangerous attack.
The building belonging to the Church of St. Gregory the Illuminator, which is our cultural center, was set on fire.
Although the walls of the building are still stable, we are not sure how long they will last, and the interior is nearly unusable”,- she said.
The building was built in the 1900s and housed the church office and the Sunday school.
There were kept rare books, documents of the Armenian National Committee which were completely destroyed.

On behalf of the Armenian community, the Armenian National Committee of Australia addressed an open letter to Prime Minister Scott Morison and called for recognition of the Genocide of Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks in the Ottoman Empire.
According to Armenpress, the commission called on the Prime Minister to remain true to his speech in Parliament back in 2011, in which he stated that “the Armenian Genocide is one of the worst crimes against humanity, and it is important Australia recognises it.”
Although as parliamentarian he spoke out for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, nevertheless, after taking the post of Prime Minister in 2018, he began to abandon the term “genocide” due to some external pressure.
“Now is the time to recognise the Armenian Genocide.
The changing political atmosphere around the Armenian Genocide issue in Australia and the international positive steps towards the recognition of the Genocide make us believe that now is the time,” is mentioned in the letter.
Recalling that America is also positive on this issue, the members of the commission stressed that now is the time to reject Turkey’s threats.
“On behalf of the 50,000 Armenian community in Australia, we urge you to officially call the events of 1915 a genocide,” the commission said.

The Armenian professor will create solar and laser sails
Is it possible to communicate with the universe through the sun? Armenian professor Artur Davoyan is trying to find the answer to this question with his colleagues.
They are trying to create sun sails.
The idea seemed complicated at first, but now they are moving forward with clear steps.
The project is funded by NASA.
“Of course, we cannot see the sun rays clearly, but the sun’s energy cannot only heat, but also push some objects.
It is a very time-consuming work, but we must create a large area where the solar energy will push those sails in a specific direction,” said the professor.
The other program is about laser sails, or as they call it: “Breakthrough Starshot”.
It is planned to use a sail, due to which it will take only 20 years to reach the nearest star system, that is the alpha of Centaurus.
“My group is working on the design of that spacecraft.
Now we are trying to solve some technical problems, what the spacecraft should look like in order to be able to withstand this high-power laser radiation and communication, and how it will send signals when it reaches space,” said Davoyan.
The professor says that they also have an Armenian department, the aim of which is to understand what projects are there in Armenia that they can support.
Now they are implementing the “Clean Room” project together with the Alikhanyan National Institute.
The goal is to be able to control the dust content in the air.
Artur Davoyan also plans to visit Armenia.
Until then, interested people can apply to him, he is ready to work and listen to new ideas.
The Armenian school in Minsk has been helping its students to preserve their Armenian identity in a foreign country for 15 yearsFifteen years ago, thanks to the efforts of the Armenian community in Belarus, an Armenian school was opened in Minsk.
This is how another unique center was created to preserve the Armenian identity in the diaspora.
Today, there are 64 students and 7 teachers in Sunday school.
Nune Khachaturyan came to school as a history teacher a year ago.
‘We have different groups: one preschool, 3 primary, 2 secondary, 1 senior.
Students mainly develop the Armenian oral speech, study the Armenian language, patriotism, the history of the Armenian people, national songs and dances’’,-said Nune Khachaturyan.
Students enjoy attending classes, and to avoid stress and stay motivated for attending school on Sundays, teachers conduct lessons through games and surprises.
They also watch films, discuss them; there is a discussion club.
Nune Khachaturyan assures that they show an individual approach to every child and are very willing to help them preserve their Armenian identity in a foreign country.
‘’In general, school and education, Armenian upbringing in a foreign country play an important role in the preservation of Armenian identity.
After all, students who study in Armenian schools in any foreign country today have a mission.
They must know, learn, preserve and pass on to the next generations the Armenian history and the Armenian language’’,-she said.
Open lessons are often held at the school; the song and dance ensemble "Nairi" is always the first in various competitions, and they celebrate the Day of the Armenian Army in a special way, telling about the Armenian heroes and their exploits.
School principal Gayane Aghajanyan says that, especially a few months ago, during the war, current and former students of the school often asked teachers about the situation at the border and what kind of help was needed.
‘’All holidays and events, in general, everything that happens in Armenia, good and bad news, are immediately transferred to the school.
On Sundays, these very topics are discussed during history, language, song lessons.
In other words, the topics are mixed’’,- said the Principal of the school.
Many students of the Armenian school in Minsk often visited Armenia within the framework of the "Ari Tun" program.
However, the school principal wishes to see even closer cooperation with Armenia so that students can actively participate in various activities and events in their homeland.

The Armenian violinist Samvel Yervinyan who performs in the orchestra of the world famous Greek musician Yanni spoke about his years in ArmeniaBeloved Yerevan is in his memories.
He misses his homeland and compatriots very much.
The talented American-Armenian violinist Samvel Yervinyan left the best years of his childhood and youth in Armenia and left for the USA in 2002 pursuing great goals.
“It is difficult for every Armenian to leave Armenia, but in terms of music and my career Armenia had become small for me.
This was the main reason for my departure, and the time proved that I made the right choice” - Samvel said.
Relatives have felt Samvel's love for music since childhood.
At the age of 3 he was already singing, and after a few years he began to play the piano and violin.
I entered the music school after Spendiaryan but to the string department, which was strange because the grades for the violin were expected to be lower than those for the piano, since the violin is a harder instrument to play.
Anyway, my parents agreed with the condition that after a year of studying to play violin, I would transfer to the piano department” - said the violinist.
For Samvel Yervinyan, it was a fatal decision because that was how the future path of the famous musician was predetermined.
He chose the violin and tied himself to music forever.
“I was lucky that my first teacher was Armen Minasyan, a genius person to whom I am very grateful.
I did not transfer to the piano department, as he awakened a great love for the violin in me” - he said.
To be a real musician, one needs to live and think like a musician, love the instrument and sounds that can tell a lot to the audience.
With this in his mind, the diaspora musician has performed in about 52 countries since 1993.
He also had many concerts in Armenia, which were always accompanied by a warm welcome for the artist and a good mood of the Armenian audience.
The last concert that took place in 2018 was the most impressive.
“That was a very good concert in Yerevan, I want everyone to know that I love them very much.
On that day, they proved that we can still listen to music” - Samvel said.
Samvel Yervinyan has been collaborating with the world famous Greek musician Yanni for many years.
The last concert of the orchestra took place in Mexico City; they have many more concerts planned.

This time, a protest was held in front of the Israeli company Elbit Systems which produces arms and sells them to Azerbaijan.

If we do not raise up together with all Armenians and do not fight, I think everything can end badly” - Christine Movsesyan said.
Christine Movsesyan believes that one should not wait for a new war and only then demand to stop selling arms to Azerbaijan.
She calls on all Armenians in the Diaspora to join them.
“There is no need to wait for the start of another war and then only to take to the streets.
All Armenians of the Diaspora should go to the Israeli embassies with flags and photographs of the Lora ballistic missile by which Azerbaijan bombed Artsakh and try to stop the sale of weapons to Azerbaijan" - Movsesyan stressed.
Jews also took part in the demonstration organized by the Armenians in Israel.
According to Christine Movsesyan, the protests will continue until Israel stops or reduces the sale of arms to Azerbaijan.

$ 500 of that amount was transferred to the "Give Me Hope" organization in Prague, which was engaged in the prosthetics program for Armenian soldiers.
The rest of the money was donated to the Masyatsotn Diocese of Armenia, the Tavush Diocese, the Gugark Diocese and the "Defender of the Homeland" Rehabilitation Center.

The Armenians of the Czech Republic submitted a petition in defense of Artsakh and appealed to the Czech Parliament

The representative of the Union of Armenian Youth of the Czech Republic Hakob Avetisyan told "Hayern Aysor" that they submitted a petition in defense of Artsakh and appealed to the Czech parliament.
“On October 3, we organized an online petition collecting about 3,000 signatures in 3 days.
Then a physical petition was organized, on paper, to be sent to the Czech parliament to move on to the discussion and we hope that the Czech Republic will finally express its opinion, its objective word about the aggression towards the Artsakh population and the Armenian people”,- Avetisyan said.
According to the representative of the Armenian community, the Czech Republic responds positively to their initiatives and tends to trust the Armenians.
According to him, there were Czechs in Artsakh who shared information about the situation from there.
“We have a lot of letters from Czechs who want to help us.
There are people who participated in the humanitarian aid sent to Armenia, there are those who wanted to help with money.
Despite the fact that we are very far from you, we are on your side and I am sure that many people are ready to side with the Armenians”,- said Hakob Avetisyan.

The Armenians Union of Europe will focus on attracting investments in ArmeniaThe Armenians Union of Europe is changing its strategy to focus on attracting investments in Armenia.
The president of the union, businessman Artur Hovhannisyan, emphasizes that the cooperation programs with the Armenian communities of Europe will be further expanded in the next five years.
“We need to develop more business, help the business, help to create jobs in Armenia.
The emphasis will be on those areas,” said Artur Hovhannisyan.
From June 10 to 25, the delegation of the Armenians Union of Europe will visit Armenia and Artsakh.
Opportunities to implement business plans will be discussed in situ.
“We will work with several organizations and structures to be able to invest in the homeland, creating jobs, giving people the opportunity to work so that they can earn more money,” said Vice President Artak Sergoyan.
“At the end of the year, 5-10 programs will be selected, which will be more serious programs. We will support them financially and with human resources, so that those programs will come to life,” the President said.
The Armenians Union of Europe condemns the demonstrations during the visit of Armenia’s acting prime minister to France.
They describe this step as an ugly phenomenon, emphasizing that such an attitude should not be shown towards an official representing a country in a foreign country.
“It is not accepted in the Diaspora.
We should not interfere too much in the political atmosphere of Armenia.
The Diaspora must always have its special status, there must be a balancing party between the parties of Armenia, the government and the Diaspora,” Arthur Hovhannisyan emphasized.
“Regardless of the tense political situation in the country, regardless of the status of the head of the country, and regardless that who will become the head of the country, we have no right to show our family problems abroad.
No need to lapidate.
If we have a problem, if we are engaged in politics or some active public activity, they should go to Armenia.
In Armenia, you can express your opinion openly, express your thoughts.
I consider it “clumsiness”,” Artak Sergoyan mentioned.
The Diaspora is in a waiting situation right now.
The further cooperation between the Diaspora structures and Armenia will become clearer after the elections.
Until then, they emphasize, the Armenia-Artsakh-Diaspora connection must be kept strong.
The Australian Armenians are actively involved in political and propaganda work for the recognition of ArtsakhFor a month now, the Armenians of the whole world have united to advance the issue of recognizing Artsakh and tell the world about the Azerbaijani-Turkish aggression.
The hard work of the Armenians in Australia yielded results.

“Of course, we called on the Australian government to adequately respond to the situation”, - said the Executive Director of the Armenian National Committee of Australia Hayk Kayseryan in an interview with "Hayern Aysor".
A large-scale demonstration took place in Sydney last week.
500 participants were expected but thousands of Armenians joined the protest.
“My appeal to our community has always been that before one lays his head on the pillow in the evening, he should ask himself if he has done enough for the Motherland that day.
This is our challenge today and we must stick to it.
We will win together!” - he said.
At the moment, the Armenian communities of Australia and New Zealand have raised $ 2.7 million to help Artsakh.
The Australian Government has stressed the importance of the right of people to self-determination
Australian Foreign Minister Meris Payne reaffirmed the Australian government's readiness to support the OSCE Minsk Group, stressing that the "right of people to self-determination" is one of the three main aspects of the final settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
The Armenian National Committee of Australia reports.
In response to the letter from the Armenian National Committee of Australia and the Armenian community of Australia, Minister Payne welcomed the cessation of hostilities, noting that both sides must follow the Final Helsinki Provisions - not use force or threats, maintain territorial integrity and the right of people to equality and self-determination.
Hayk Kayseryan, the Executive Director of the Armenian National Committee of Australia, noted: “It is important for the Armenian community of Australia that the OSCE Minsk Group, together with the three co-chair countries, lead the peace talks in Nagorno-Karabakh.
It is very important to respect the right of the Armenians of the Republic of Artsakh to self-determination.
We must start with returning back to Armenia of all military and civil captives whom Azerbaijan continues detaining and torturing.
And also, the Azerbaijani authorities who make decisions in Nagorno-Karabakh should be replaced by peacekeeping forces until all Armenian cultural and religious monuments were deliberately destroyed."
The Armenian National Committee of the ARF Bureau noted that over 3,000 Australians had signed the letter to the Australian Parliament calling for the recognition of the independence of Artsakh as the only way to ensure the security of the indigenous Armenians in the region.

Another 9th grade textbook published the same year states that the khanates of Yerevan and Nakhichevan which were part of Eastern Armenia came under Russian control.
The embassy demands to republish the textbook and mention that Eastern Armenia is a geographical name.
This is another attempt by Azerbaijan to distort history in which the Ambassador of Azerbaijan to Russia Polad Bulbuloglu plays a big role.

“The championship is going very well, I am happy to be in Armenia.” Belgian weightlifter 
 "Hayern Aysor" spoke with Belgian Nina Sterckx, an athlete of the European Weightlifting Championship.
Please tell us your feelings, impressions about the whole competition.
I had a very bad preparation.
I did senior roles last year in December and that competition was really good and it was really strong there.
And after that I had a two week break and then in January I started again and I had multiple injuries and I had one back injury that was really bad and I couldn't lift for like a month.
So, my back injury is still there.
So, I'm like 90% healed, but it's not fully healed yet.
And I also have a wrist injury which is still painful now.
And that's why I came to this competition, to just try to have fun and not to think about the result too much because I knew that I wasn't fully prepared.
That's why I also lifted less now than I did last year.
But I'm just happy that I am able to lift now because a few weeks ago I couldn't lift because of my back.
So I'm really happy about that.
And I had a lot of fun and I'm really happy about my medals because last year I had bronze and it's also the first time in a new weight class, so it was also hard to change that.
So overall I'm really happy.
So how do you handle the pressure of performing on a big stage like this, like the European Championship?
It really helps to focus on myself because you never know what other people will do.
Sometimes they will do 10 kg more, sometimes they will bomb out.
You never know what they will do.
So you can just only focus on yourself and try to lift as much as you can and then you just see what the result is.
But that's how I handle it, because you cannot control what other people do, but you can control what you do.
So that works for me.
So do you have any pre-competition tools?
Not really.
Like the day itself, I try not to think about my competition too much.
I just try to watch some videos and distract myself, but during the competition, like all competitions, they are never the same, so you need to adapt when something changes.
So yeah, it changes all the time.
I don't really have any rituals.
Is this your first time in Armenia?
Yes, yes.
Did you have time to visit some sightseeings here?
I didn't have time yet to go somewhere and see something.
We are flying back tonight, so maybe we have some time tonight.
But I really liked it.
People are very friendly.
There are a lot of people who speak English too. So that's really helpful for us.
The food is really good.
That's important.
The competition is also really good.
The competition hall is very nice and has a really good training hall too.
So I really like it here.

The Deputy Prime Minister took part in a video conference with a number of representatives of the Diaspora 
On March 25, Tigran Avinyan participated in an online video conference initiated by the representatives of the “Armenian North-American medical communities” of the United States and Canada operating in the Diaspora.
During the video conference, the Deputy Prime Minister made a welcoming speech. “Welcome to this online discussion.
We highly appreciate the support of our compatriots from the Diaspora sent to their homeland.
In difficult days, the Diaspora is by the side of the homeland, and the war unleashed by Azerbaijan against Artsakh was no exception.
In those days, the material and psychological support of the Diaspora was very important for us, for which I would like to thank each of you.
We attach importance to constant consultations with our compatriots from the Diaspora, during which we have the opportunity not only to get acquainted with each other’s opinions and views, but also to exchange the necessary information.
We are open to proposals and are selflessly interested in finding solutions to the various  problems facing our homeland in an atmosphere of mutual agreement.
Our discussion today addresses the issue of importing charitable goods.
We know that our compatriots in the Diaspora have a number of misunderstandings in this area related to the regulations on the import of goods, which, we think, mainly comes from a lack of information.
Clear steps are being taken in this direction.
Especially during the war the government simplified procedures as much as possible to avoid unnecessary hassles.
In January, all Armenian embassies abroad received detailed information, a guide on what steps to take to avoid complications.
We have also provided contacts with the staff of the Humanitarian Department, through which the project implementer can be informed in advance about the necessary steps.
Also, a short video about the procedures was posted on the RA government’s page today, and in the future a short video about the procedures will be spread on the social media pages of our embassies.
In this way, we work to avoid problems as much as possible, to raise public awareness.” 
The video conference was attended by employees of the office of Deputy Prime Minister Tigran Avinyan, as well as other responsible government bodies.
During the discussion, the issues of customs clearance of cargo transportation, mechanisms of rapid distribution of cargo, demand for charitable cargo, cooperation with the authorized body in Armenia were touched upon.
The Diaspora is also a battlefield where we must continue our political and diplomatic workIn a number of French cities, such as Paris, Valence and Marseille, Armenian communities organized large-scale demonstrations in support of Armenia and Artsakh.
Murad Papazyan, Co-Chairman of the Coordination Council of Armenian Organizations of France said in an interview with “Hayern Aysor”.
“We organized yesterday's demonstration in 36 hours, about 2000 people gathered.
People ask how to help, how to go there, how to send money, medicines.
Undoubtedly, the war in Artsakh is at the epicenter of attention, but the Diaspora is also a battlefield where we must continue our political and diplomatic struggle”,- Papazyan said.
According to Murad Papazyan, they will continue to conduct political and diplomatic work in France and in the diaspora and are in constant touch with the French President and his staff.
In his words, France is doing everything to form a pro-Armenian position on the Artsakh issue.
The Diaspora stands firmly behind the peoples of Armenia and Artsakh. The Armenian community of Luxembourg held protest actions
The Armenian community in Luxembourg is small but like in a number of other countries it has united in the name of peace in Artsakh.
According to Tatev Manukyan-Engel, the honorary consul of Armenia in Luxembourg, the diaspora has united as never before to tell the world about the situation in Artsakh and present the truth.
“The first demonstration in Luxembourg was organized very spontaneously.
7 people stood in the central square with their posters showing people and “silently shouting” about the cruel events.
After that, we can say that we came to our senses from this very negative flow of information, we realized that we need to organize the demonstrations again as soon as possible in order to do something very important: to get the attention of the media”,- said the Armenian consul in an interview with "Hayern Aysor".
According to her, from the very first day there were many calls and letters related to donations.
Those wishing to make a donation were immediately directed to the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund.
“The registration of the results is carried out continuously and I think that this is thanks not only to the diaspora but also to the foreign friends of Armenia who have their own part.
And here I dare to mention also the part of my husband.
Being the leader of the largest party in Luxembourg he does a lot of political propaganda”,- said Tatev Manukyan adding that in interviews with a number of local media she made it clear that the only way to achieve peace is to recognize the Republic of Artsakh.

According to him, at this moment, the Armenian side must limit the potential of the Azerbaijanis’ actions:
“Politically, our task is the following: First, not to allow the situation to get out of control, that is, to do our best to rule out any scenario of war or military conflict, and second, to get the Azerbaijani armed forces to leave the territory of Armenia,” he said.
Nikol Pashinyan also referred to the document spread on the Internet, which, according to the rumors, he is going to sign.
He described the publication of that document as an activity of the Azerbaijani agency network.
Pashinyan considered it possible to analyze from where the documents of the trilateral discussions end up in the hands of different circles:
“Can you imagine, if we publish this paper, the whole content is covered, and we say: Look what evidence we have, an anti-Armenian document is being signed. If so, on the contrary, its lines should not be hidden, rather openly presented to the public, right? Then why are you hiding them?” he added.
Nikol Pashinyan said that there were agreements with international partners, solutions were proposed, which, according to him, correspond to Armenia’s interests.
“If Azerbaijan implements those agreements, in the conditions we have talked about, then yes, I will sign that document, because it is 100% in line with the national interests of Armenia,” he said.
According to the Acting Prime Minister, Azerbaijan has agents of information struggle in the political elite of Armenia, who these days support Azerbaijan with their activities.
He also described the distribution of a video with the participation of Armenian and Azerbaijani soldiers as pro-Azerbaijani activity, which has become a subject of wide discussion on the Internet.
“And those same people publish on their pages, hiding the fact that its source is Azerbaijani.
Can you imagine that an operation that took place within two hours, was published a fragment of 3 minutes from it! I cannot describe this as anything other than destructive activity carried out in the back,” Pashinyan said.
After all, what was the purpose of the actions of the Azerbaijani side on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, Nikol Pashinyan considered one of the options to provoke a war:
“And if the situation got out of control, uncontrollable events could develop there, which could lead us to very big problems later.
So, I consider our approach that we have decided to solve the issue through our international security mechanisms is correct.
And, at this moment, at least, it justifies itself.
But since there is no fact, we cannot say that we have achieved our goal through that way,” he added.
Nikol Pashinyan called on the public not to give in to the provocations of the Azerbaijani propaganda network in Armenia, saying that they are working diligently to protect the national interests of Armenia and Artsakh, and to solve the problems.

Many Diaspora Armenians have earned respect for their participation in the construction of their homeland.
Hrayr Hovnanyan even played a special role in them.
He was the first rich Armenian who built his home and settled in his homeland,” he concluded.

"The interests of Armenia should be put above all else." Catholicos Aram I
The Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia Aram I expressed concern about the events in Armenia.
In particular, he wrote: “Neither the old nor the new storms of our history, neither our old nor our new enemies could destroy our home, Armenia.
We must not destroy it ourselves.
We are accountable to our saints, martyrs and our history."
According to Aram I, everyone should always put the interests of Armenia above all else.
It should be reminded that on February 25 the General Staff of the RA Armed Forces  demanded the resignation of the RA Prime Minister and Government.
The Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan said live on Facebook that he had made a decision to dismiss the Chief of the RA General Staff Onik Gasparyan and prepared the necessary documents.
Then Nikol Pashinyan called a rally on Republic Square, followed by a march through the central streets of Yerevan.
At the same time, the opposition rally was taking place on Freedom Square.
They blocked Baghramyan Avenue and spent the night there.
The issue of de-occupation of the territory of the NKAO should be made a negotiating issue: Nikol Pashinyan
During a question-and-answer session with the government in the National Assembly, Nikol Pashinyan stated that Azerbaijan refused to discuss the status of Nagorno-Karabakh as an agenda item during the war and before that.
“Analyzing the situation, after consulting with the President of Artsakh and the General Staff of the Armed Forces, I decided that we should reach a ceasefire through certain, and even difficult, concessions.
In this regard, I convened a meeting of the Security Council, which was attended by the representatives of parliamentary factions.
The meeting was attended by the President of the RA and the Supreme Patriarch.
On the same day, I invited the representatives of the extra-parliamentary opposition and once again informed them about the current events,” Pashinyan said.
The PM noted that after that, according to the agreement, he called the President of the Russian Federation to say that Armenia wants a ceasefire on the condition of returning the territories at a format of 5+2.
“A condition, which was previously put forward by the negotiators in various formats.
We have reached a common understanding with the President of the Russian Federation.
We have stated with the President of the Russian Federation that we have a common way of overcoming the situation.
You know that there was a question of the return of refugees, there was a question of the return of Azerbaijani migrants to Nagorno-Karabakh, I said that we would have no objections in principle if the issue was somehow linked to the process of clarifying the status of Nagorno-Karabakh.
The President of the Russian Federation held a telephone conversation with the President of Azerbaijan, as a result of which it became clear that the Azerbaijani side categorically does not accept our demand for deoccupation of the Hadrut district.
Secondly, he requires that the issue of the return of migrants, including to Shushi, should not be associated with the clarification of the status.
There was also a hint that there should be no return of territories according to the 5+2 format, but the return of 7 territories,” the Prime Minister noted.
Nikol Pashinyan added that this was said as a hint in case Armenia agrees to the conditions proposed before this point.
“Azerbaijan, both before and during the war, refused to discuss the issue of the status of Nagorno Karabakh as an issue on the agenda,” Pashinyan said.
The RA Prime Minister stressed that the issue of deoccupation of the territory of the Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous region should be raised as a political, negotiating issue.
“I want to draw the attention of all of us to the fact that we must talk about the future.
The most important part of this conversation about the future is the solution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
I want to emphasize that we, as a political issue, should raise the issue of deoccupation of the territory of the Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous region.
Once again, we should formulate this not as a military issue but as a political issue of negotiations,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that it is necessary to consistently continue the implementation of the resolution “shutdown for salvation” for Nagorno Karabakh. “You saw what happened in Azerbaijan yesterday or the day before yesterday, it is the biggest manifestation of Armenian hatred. I think we should draw everyone’s attention from all platforms, that a museum of war suffering and victims may be opened in a country, which is the biggest manifestation of hatred.
And this is the biggest basis for us to show the international community the applicability of the principle of “shutdown for salvation” for Nagorno-Karabakh, which should be the core of our further negotiation process,” Pashinyan said.
The issue of recognizing the Armenian Genocide after 106 years: What new steps need to be taken?
Why did the Armenian Genocide take place? Why have its consequences not disappeared yet? These are ongoing questions that are still being studied even after 106 years.
Member of Parliament Vladimir Vardanyan thinks that at present time there are certain successes in the issue of recognizing the Genocide.
“Almost all major European countries are already going for recognition, at least at the level of parliamentary recognition.
And we must continue that process, because those political recognitions create a very good basis for launching legal processes,” Vladimir Vardanyan said.
According to Vladimir Vardanyan, it is necessary to continue working with Diaspora partners and keep the issue of the Genocide recognition in the center of attention in international institutions.
And as long as we have a situation where the perpetrator does not accept the fact of the Genocide, when the consequences of that crime have not been eliminated, moreover, the criminal tries to continue his criminal genocidal intention, all this makes us take much more serious steps.
Let's take action in this direction.
Keeping constant public attention on this issue means that you have not forgotten, you remember, you continue to carry the identity of your ancestors, to demand the elimination of its legal consequences.” Vardanyan emphasized.
Historian Varak Ketsemanyan uses the process of studying and developing various mechanisms related to the Genocide.
“For example, the connection with the Russian response to the Genocide, the role of orphans and women during the Genocide, rescue work, at the local level, specifically city-wide studies.
I would focus on these two main directions. I think if we continue to work in this direction, we can achieve a much more comprehensive understanding of what the Genocide was, how it happened, and by what mechanisms,” he said.
The historian divides the work of the Diaspora in these issues into 3 groups: political, cultural, educational.
According to him, the activity of the Armenian communities is a possible factor of awareness, to influence different countries in the issue of the Genocide recognition, to suppress the mechanisms that Turkey uses after the last Artsakh War; denying the Genocide.
“Turkey has already started to put pressure on America and the European parliaments, saying that after the victory of the Artsakh War we have already started a dialogue with Armenia.
We should not fall into that trap, because this is a rather old trick that the Turkish state uses to counterbalance the work of recognizing the Armenian Genocide.”
According to the historian, the issue of the Genocide recognition has moved to a larger field, where work should be continued, presenting the Genocide as a universal crime, the recognition of which will reaffirm historical and human justice.

The Kremlin sees the confident victory of Pashinyan's party in the elections: Peskov
The spokesman for the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, stated that the Kremlin is following the election situation in Armenia and wants the people's decision to help the country move towards sustainable development.
"We welcome the information of the Central Electoral Commission of Armenia that this election has taken place.
And, of course, we see that Pashinyan's party won with confidence.
We congratulate the Armenian people for the elections.

Citizens over the age of 27 who have not served in the army and are on the wanted list will have the opportunity to return to the homeland.
According to the new bill, the deputies offer all those who did not complete the mandatory military service to pay the salary of a contract soldier with a surcharge and return home.
«The law calls, guys, return home.
Firstly, a number of laws will be changed.
We have raised the age limit for returning home.
In other words, one should not hope to just automatically get rid of criminal liability after reaching a certain age». Andranik Kocharyan, deputy.
According to preliminary estimates, this amount will be from 5 to 5.5 million drams but it may change, if the government decides to increase the salaries of military personnel under the contract.
It is possible to receive the money back, if the citizen decides to enter military service under the contract within 3 years after payment.
«I am convinced that as a result of the application of this law, the number of evaders from military service will gradually decrease.
The optimism was justified when analyzing the results of this year's conscription, as our number increased». Andranik Kocharyan, deputy.
Citizens who have not served in accordance with the current legislation and are on the wanted list will be subject to criminal liability if they arrive in Armenia.
This bill creates another opportunity to attract the potential of the diaspora to Armenia.
«We offer a new solution, a new way of institutional solution of this problem.
You probably know that due to constant violations earlier, the law on citizens who did not undergo mandatory military service  was being extended for years, and already in March 2019 this law became invalid». Mkhitar Hayrapetyan, deputy.
The age limit for the termination of criminal prosecution has been increased.
If, according to the current legislation, the criminal prosecution is terminated after reaching the age of 37, the new draft law proposes to terminate it only after reaching the age of 47.
«From now on, we also consider evading military service as a grave crime, since we consider it important, on the one hand, to propose solutions and on the other hand, we are obliged to introduce mechanisms that will prevent further emigration.
In other words, in relation to people who intend to use this opportunity in the future and return to Armenia at the age of 37, the criminal case will be terminated due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.
In this context, we are on the path of tightening, because, yes, we consider ourselves obliged to offer solutions but on the other hand, we make sure that all obligations to the state are properly fulfilled by our compatriots». Mkhitar Hayrapetyan, deputy.
According to the MPs, this project is a way to reduce emigration and change public thinking.
The bill will make it possible to create a professional army where one will serve on a contract basis.

The film dedicated to the Artsakh conflict was screened at the Berlin International Film Festival "Berlinale", despite the anti-Azerbaijani accusations.
The film "Black Bach Artsakh" directed by Ayrin Anastas from Palestine and Rene Capri from Iran tells the story of the 12-year Artsakh-Azerbaijan conflict.
To the music of the composer Bach, the 13-episode film shows episodes reflecting the war, identity, belonging, and interviews with the Armenian residents of the region in 2007.
Azerbaijanis and Turks complained noting that the film is a propaganda, and the events are presented one-sided.
They demanded to cancel the screening of the film, especially criticizing the part where the Artsakh conflict of the 90’s is presented as a struggle for liberation and self-determination, and the 44-day war of 2020 as the invasion of the dictator of Azerbaijan.
Despite protests, organizers of the festival rejected calls to remove the film from the program, saying that even though the film tells about complex issues of conflict and painful memories, the filmmakers have the right to express themselves.

Arthur Umrshatyan, the head of the RA Police Patrol Service, mentioned that this is a very responsible day for them, as the "philosophy of the patrol service" and the tasks set by the patrol service are fundamentally different from the tasks performed by the foreign police services so far.
"Both the staff and the management have a great sense of responsibility.
We have a clear idea of ​​what the society expects from us, in general, what problem we have to solve, in the short and long term.

The peace agreement requires a peace process that stopped after the use of force by Azerbaijan. RA MFA
The anti-Armenian stance and behavior of the Azerbaijani leadership do not give grounds to expect constructiveness from the Azerbaijani authorities to seek solutions to the situation created as a result of the aggression unleashed against Artsakh.
The spokeswoman of the RA Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Anna Naghdalyan, mentioned this in an interview with "Armenpress" responding to the statement of the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliev on the offer of a peace treaty to Armenia.
“The vivid evidence of what I have said is the statements made by the President of Azerbaijan at the opening of the “park” dedicated to the Artsakh war in Baku on April 12.
All these, as well as the manipulation of the issue of the prisoners of war by Azerbaijan, proves how far the Azerbaijani leadership stands from its own declarative statements on the post-war situation, regional peace and reconciliation,” she said.
According to her, the President of Azerbaijan continues to make contradictory statements. On one hand, they present the thesis that the conflict has been resolved to their own audience, on the other hand, they present to the international audience the signing of a peace agreement and the unresolved issues of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
“Let’s just make a simple observation in this regard that the signing of a peace treaty requires first of all a peace process, which stopped after the use of force by Azerbaijan,” said Naghdalyan, adding that in the context of the peace treaty alluded to by Aliev, no meeting is planned in the near future.
As for Aliev’s statements expressing his aspirations towards Zangezur, Sevan and Yerevan, the RA Foreign Ministry spokeswoman considered it ridiculous that the leader of a country whose name even in the South Caucasus has only a century-old history, both politically and geopolitically, yet presents territorial claims to the cradle of the Armenian people.
“We understand that a new identity has been formed in Azerbaijan over the last hundred years, but we consider it necessary to emphasize again that history is not the strong point of Azerbaijan.” 
“Such provocative statements undermine the efforts aimed at establishing stability in the region, which is a threat to all states in the region,” said Anna Naghdalyan.
She stressed that Armenia expects the active support of the international community, first of all, the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs, international specialized structures, to ensure a safe and quick return of all the prisoners of war, civilians and hostages kept in Azerbaijan.
On April 13, there was a statement by the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs, in which the above-mentioned issue was specifically mentioned.
“As you know, many of our international partners have expressed their position on this issue, saying that the prisoners of war should be repatriated immediately,” the RA Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already presented its position, many times, at different levels. According to the international humanitarian law, in particular the Geneva Conventions on the trilateral declaration of the ceasefire of September 27, 2020; All the servicemen and civilians captured by Azerbaijan during and after the armed aggression against the Artsakh Republic must be repatriated without any preconditions, on the principle of “all for all”.

The tabernacle of the Church of St. Elijah in Israel has been renovated
The only church in the northern regions of Israel was renovated by the efforts of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem and  the Armenian community.
The Church of St. Elijah is one of the sights of the Israeli city of Haifa.
Priest Hovakimyan's dream was to renovate the church; only the tabernacle remained to be repaired.
“When a church is under construction, especially when a new tabernacle is installed, it is necessary to consecrate it, to conduct the rite of the “defiled temple,” and only after that can the liturgy be served.
And, fortunately, we completed the renovation at a time when the virus restrictions had already been partially lifted” - Priest Tirayr Hovakimyan said.
The floor of the tabernacle was damaged, there was a danger of collapse.
The priest says that a detailed work has been done.
The renovation began in September and finished in December, and at the beginning of March this year, the church was consecrated and a liturgy was served.
More than 100 Armenians took part in the consecration ceremony, and the women prepared food and treated everyone at the churchyard.
“The role of the church is very important in the diaspora and especially in Israel.
From time immemorial to the present day, clergymen have always taught religion, the Bible, history and language in Armenian schools and circles.
Basically, the success of the Armenian community in Haifa is due to the connection between the church and the community because they always cooperate” - he said.
Haifa Armenians get married and baptized in this church.
The Armenian community of the city is not very big: only 5 weddings a year.
And if usually only relatives and friends are invited to the wedding, the entire Armenian community gathers in Haifa to celebrate the important event together.

Under the title of urban development programs, the authorities also discussed and approved the plan of demolishing all the Armenian houses in the Kalé district of Mush.

There is an Armenian house in the Kalé district, which is registered as a protected cultural value.
Opposition MPs also noted that the authorities are artificially creating programs to eliminate Armenian houses and neighborhoods.

The United States has called to respect the election results in Armenia
The United States congratulates the people of Armenia for the June 20 election, said State Department spokeswoman Ned Price.
"The United States congratulates the people of Armenia for the June 20 parliamentary elections.
We welcome the overall positive assessment of the elections by the observation mission.
We are glad that according to the preliminary assessment of the observation mission, according to which human rights and fundamental freedoms were generally respected, the participants of the election campaign had the opportunity to campaign freely, and the counting of votes on election day was positive.
We share the observation mission's concern about polarization among the parties participating in the elections and about rude rhetoric.
We call on the parties to respect the aftermath of the election results, to implement the legal process of appealing the elections, and to avoid political retaliation, as Armenia continues on its path to a sovereign, democratic, peaceful and prosperous future.
The United States seeks to strengthen its partnership with Armenia based on shared democratic values.
We welcome Armenia's progress in reforms, in the fight against corruption, and call for it to continue in line with the aspirations of the Armenian people in the spring of 2018.
We call on all parties to respect the rule of law and democratic principles.
"We hope to work with the new government to develop bilateral relations and cooperation," the statement said.
The US Congressman called for a review of the territorial violations committed by Azerbaijan  
The US Congressman Brad Sherman has called on the administration of US President Joe Biden to reconsider Resolution 907 of “the Freedom Support Act”, which provides military assistance to Azerbaijan.
Sherman said in his message.
"In 2019, the US Congress recognized the Armenian Genocide.
The fact of the Genocide was also recognized by the US Presidential Administration in April this year.
However, the US administration has passed Resolution 907 of “the Freedom Support Act”, which authorizes the sale of arms to Azerbaijan.
At the end of his speech, Brad Sherman expressed hope that the document would be reviewed, as Azerbaijan violates not only Artsakh’s border, which is also very important, but also the territorial integrity of the Republic of Armenia.
The US State Department issued a statement on the process of releasing Hambik Sasunyan
At the end of February, the Los Angeles Supreme Court lifted the ban on the release of the American-Armenian Hambik Sasunyan.
The Governor of California has decided not to appeal.
On March 11, the US State Department issued a statement expressing disappointment with the court's decision.
“The United States remains committed to the position that those who kill diplomats should receive the maximum penalty without parole.
Once again, we extend our deepest condolences to Mr. Arikan's family and our colleagues in Turkish Foreign Ministry” - the statement said.
Hambik Sasunyan was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1982 on charges of the homicide of the Turkish Consul General in Los Angeles Kemal Arikan.
It was noted that Sasunyan committed the crime to avenge Turkey for the Armenian Genocide committed in the Ottoman Empire in 1915.
The decision to release Sasounyan in 2016 was rejected by the former governor of California.
According to some rumors, the process of Hambik Sasunyan's release will begin in the coming days.

The US State Department presented an annual report on International Religious Freedom, in which it referred to the condition of the Armenian monuments in Artsakh, which are on the territory of the enemy.

The report also recorded the fact of the double bombing of the Holy Savior Ghazanchetsots Church in Shushi.
According to the report, the Armenian side stated that after taking control of Shushi, on November 14, Azerbaijani forces desecrated the Holy Savior Church.
The text also mentions that the Russian peacekeepers took over the medieval monastery of Dadivank, which came under the control of Azerbaijan after the war in autumn.
“President Aliyev’s public statement that the churches of Karvachar belong to the old state of Caucasian Albania has raised concerns among Armenians that Azerbaijan may seek to disrupt the connection of some religious sites with their Armenian heritage,” the report said.
The weightlifting championship is organised at a high level and will only give its positive result. Nazik Avdalyan
The European Weightlifting Championship is underway in Yerevan.
“Armenians Today” interviewed the member of the championship jury, Armenian weightlifter Nazik Avdalyan.
How would you rate the course of the weightlifting championship?
The tournament is organised at a high level in terms of appearance and quality.
I have participated in weightlifting competitions in various leading countries, and I can confidently say that the one organised here is not inferior to them in any way, but even better.
In fact, I thought that if a European or World Championship was organised here, everything would be done at a high level, and that’s precisely what happened.
I am delighted that the competitions are held in Armenia.
I hope such events will often be held here, because they are essential for the country from every point of view.
As a weightlifter and a member of the jury, how would you rate the fitness of the athletes?
All athletes are in good shape; they just need to be able to show their capabilities during competitions, which is actually difficult; not every time an athlete in good shape can deliver the same capabilities on the stage, because the psychological state plays a significant role.
I wish only success to our athletes.
I really hope that everyone will have a good competition and I won’t have to press the red button as a judge.
What kind of opportunities do you think this championship creates for Armenia?
Among the participants, there are countries that have not heard about Armenia at all and, participating in the competition, they already know about us and our country, mainly that everything is organised at a high level and will only give its positive result.
It should also be taken into account that it is great excitement for society and local athletes that the competition is being held in Armenia.
People are definitely more interested now.
Also, regarding other sports, there will be an opportunity for them to consider whether they can organise similar competitions.
There are no victims among Israeli-Armenians. The situation remains tenseThe first rocket landed in the skies of Israel on May 10.
The rockets fired from Palestine were fired at Jerusalem, Tel-Aviv and the coastal cities.
According to Christina Movsesyan, co-founder of the Union of Armenian Communities in Israel, they are in constant contact with Armenian community.
“There has been chaos in Israel for several days now, there are endless bombings from Gaza, especially in the southern part of Israel, in the cities of Sderot, Netivot, Ashkelon and Ashdod.
But yesterday, at 6 o'clock, they are already firing in the direction of the center: Tel Aviv, Batt Yam, Rishon… There is no end, it is very terrible, it started since Ramadan, the Muslim holiday, as you hear in the news, it is chaos,” says Christina Movsesyan.
Now Armenians are trying to move to a safer place.
Almost all the buildings in Israel have shelters; the residents hide there during the rocket attacks.
Christina Movsesyan was in the shelter for almost 6 hours.
“There are many Armenians in the south, with whom we are in touch on online platforms. At first we said come to the center, but now it is not safe in the center either, because we have to go in the direction of Haifa, because they shoot everywhere.
We are in touch with the Armenians, when they start bombing, we are able to take refuge in the hiding places of buildings and apartments.
It will be very scary for the children, they ask questions, but we Armenians try to help each other in every way.
There are no wounded among the Armenians yet,” said Christina Movsesyan.
The situation in the streets of Israel is not calm.
Clashes broke out between the Palestinians and Israeli police over political and religious issues.
They started near the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, which is a sanctuary for both Muslim and Israelis.
The reason for the clash is a possible decision of an Israeli court to expel Palestinian families from the Sheikh-Jarrah district of East Jerusalem.
Clashes between Israelis and Palestinians have now turned into armed operations.
“Now I am at my place of work, I live in Bat Yam, my place of work is in chaos.
We help single parents and orphans.
We have many calls for help, what is happening is difficult to explain to the children, it is difficult to say that they are not afraid of the bombing.
There are people who do not come out of their hiding places, they also need help, we will provide humanitarian aid to everyone,” Christina Movsesyan emphasized.
Six people were killed in rocket attacks in Israel. 20 were injured.
There are more than 290 wounded in Palestine, more than 4 dozen people have been killed.
There is no other way but a united struggle. The Armenian community of Austria is actively working these days
Demonstrations, fundraising, active political work, public awareness, blood donation campaigns, cultural events. In recent weeks, the Armenian community in Austria has actively fought for its voice to be heard on various platforms, for an accurate presentation of the situation in Artsakh to the local society and authorities.
“The last two steps that we have worked on and still continue to work on are the adoption by the Austrian Parliament of a resolution strongly condemning Turkey's interference and calling for an end to the war and arrival to Vienna for negotiations; and we hope that the political authorities in Austria will continue to put pressure on Turkey and Azerbaijan”, - said the representative of the Armenian National Committee of Austria, a specialist in international law Gevorg Hakobjyan in an interview with "Hayern Aysor".
A few days ago, a cultural event entitled “Peace to Artsakh” took place on the Vienna Opera Square.
More than 10 world famous artists performed and expressed their protest with the help of Armenian music.
“There we clearly demanded international recognition of Artsakh”, - noted Gevorg Hakobjyan and added that the work of the last days has entered a new phase, since a clearer demand has been presented to Austria to recognize the independence of Artsakh and the right of the people to self-determination.
Gevorg Hakobjyan also noted that the local Armenian community is regularly reminded to make donations to the "Hayastan" and "1000+" funds.
Over the past few days, another 150 thousand euros have been raised.
There will be no new "March 1" in Armenia. Nikol Pashinyan
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan announced live on his Facebook that he had called a rally in Republic Square on March 1 at 18:30.
He stressed that this day is symbolic and that the rally should confirm the readiness and determination of the people to defend democracy and civil, political and constitutional order in Armenia.
“It is very important to understand that this is not about retaining my power, or the power of our ruling party but about retaining the power of the people.
I have no power in Armenia as such.
Power is held by the people who delegated this power to me for some time, and they will decide for how long.
Therefore, the first important aim of tomorrow's rally is to show the determination to uphold democratic, civil, constitutional rights and order” - the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that this time too, an attempt is being made to incite civil clashes and talk about "March 1".
Nikol Pashinyan stated that there will be no new "March 1" in Armenia, there will be no clashes.
“When the overwhelming majority of society thinks that there can be no talks of new clashes, this is the biggest guarantee” - the Prime Minister said.
According to the Prime Minister, they have no enemies in Armenia, and everyone is sisters and brothers regardless of their current views.
During the rally, Nikol Pashinyan will comment on the “March 1” trial, the attempted military coup and the decision made by the RA President yesterday.
“I will show that this is an absolutely unreasonable decision and it has no legal basis.
In this regard, conclusions will be drawn.
We will also talk about the problems of the Supreme Judicial Council because a few months ago the chairman of the SJC made almost the same inadmissible statement on which conclusions should also be drawn” - the prime minister said.
Some political forces will also be invited to the rally, and their representatives will be given the opportunity to make speeches.
The rally will end with a march.

"Hayern Aysor" spoke with Nat Arem, the owner of "Hookgrip" organization participating in the championship.
What do you think about this year’s championship in Armenia?
It’s really good.

This is a huge building for the whole European Championship, it’s almost too big for the championship.
What do you think about the opening ceremony?

It was great.
What are the impressions of the athletes and other participants?
Everyone liked it.
I’ve only heard positive things from everyone.
Everyone really likes the hotels, the competition hall, and the training hall is really big.

Here is like a platform, 2 meters, platform.
There is also more space, the halls are brand-new, and that’s all nice, good lights.
Is this your first time in Armenia?
Yes, this is my first time.
I’ve been to many countries around here, for example to Georgia, but I have never been to Armenia.
This is the first competition in Armenia.
How do you feel here?
What do you like most?
I’m mostly pretty busy because I’m mostly just here; I’m at the hotel, then here, then again the same.

Three streets in Tehran are named after Armenian martyrs’ names
According to the "Iranian-Armenians" Facebook page, three streets in the Armenian-populated Sassoun district of Tehran are named after Armenians martyred in the Iran-Iraq war: Paylag Avedian, Alfred Gabri and Vardan Aghakhanian.
Through art about Artsakh. What did the “bloody laundry“ mean? What event was organized in Canada “Bloody laundry” on the streets of Toronto.
Canadian-Armenian artist Mariam Mughdusyan expressed her protest through art.
According to her, the action had a special value: “Everyone who has visited Stepanakert and Shushi know how these colorful clothes develop like a flag during peaceful sunny days.
When clothes are covered in blood it means that a catastrophe has occurred, there are no more people there, and looking at these clothes you can understand who is no longer there.
This was the main idea”.
Mariam is a person of art and she sees her struggle through art.
According to her, the illustration is about what happens during the war, how civilians, children, women suffer because of the war.
The event was followed by a large-scale  demonstration in Ottawa which was attended by over 3,000 people.
“We demanded that they move from calls to action.
Not to temporarily suspend the supply of weapons and technologies to Turkey but to completely ban them.
This is one of the most important requirements”,- she said.
The demonstrators also demanded to recognize the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh, to stop Turkey and Azerbaijan, to give not only assessments, but also to undertake measures to impose sanctions against the aggressor.
Then the participants of the demonstration reached the NATO office where the main appeal was to deprive Turkey of NATO membership.
According to Mariam, they are thinking about different formats of protests including struggle through decentralization.

It doesn't matter what style or color you like. You will always find different design samples that you can use to decorate the interior of your own apartment on Gevorg's computer.
“When I develop a project for someone, I always do my best, as if I were doing it for myself.
I do my job with diligence and thoroughness”.
Gevorg is always surprised when people say that it is difficult to find a job in Armenia.
He proved by his own example that a hardworking person will always find a job.
“I worked in a restaurant for a while.
If I refused, I would not earn some money, and the life would be harder.
It seems to me that if someone really wishes to work, he can always find a job everywhere”.

His girlfriend and he intend to open their own studio to develop large projects.
“To be a good musician, one needs to do everything from the bottom of the heart”: Marine ManasyanMusician and composer Marine Manasyan was 9 years old when her family moved to Russia.
She spent subsequent years either in Yerevan or in Moscow.
The final decision to settle abroad was made when Marine was already 15 years old.
Now she looks back with the warmest memories of the Yerevan spring and her beloved Abovyan street.
“At the age of 15, when I was brought to Moscow, it was difficult because I did not want to move.
I always compare my relationship with Armenia to people with a broken heart, when you love someone but you cannot be with him.
I've always felt this way”.
Marine has been interested in music since childhood, she began writing songs during her school years, and later began playing the guitar and piano.
“I was 14 when I decided to start writing songs; I loved music since childhood: when my brother went to play the piano, I listened, imitated and also wanted to play but the constant moving from Yerevan to Moscow and back prevented me from entering a music school”.
It was music that introduced Marine to other music lovers, and they decided to found the group Villette, which was later renamed Deep Image.
Now Marine Manasyan performs alone in Moscow clubs.
The next concert will take place on March 25th.
“I think that in order to be a good musician, one needs to do everything from the bottom of the heart, and at the same time have an idea of why they do it.
There is freedom in music.
Playing or listening to music makes the soul soar and be free.
When one starts writing music, they must understand what they want to tell people”.
Marine claims that any art has divine power that illuminates the world and the people.
If people feel it, then you did your job well.
The musician writes in three languages: Russian, English and mostly Armenian.
She has about 45 songs released on several albums where she also performs works by Charents, Sevak and Sayat-Nova.
“For me, the Armenian language is like a divine language: when I listen to it, it seems to me that the gods speak.
In general, as a rule, music determines the language of the song.
There is music to which it is better to write in English, or, for example, in Armenian”.
Marine often visits Armenia, visits her favorite places, gives concerts.

Representative of the Armenian community of Jerusalem Harut Baghamyan.
From now on, the Armenians of Israel will be united by a single platform - the Union of Armenian Communities of Israel.
After the 44-day war in Artsakh, representatives of the Armenian community of Israel, in addition to humanitarian aid, fundraising and demonstrations, initiated the creation of a new union.
Founders Christine Movsisyan and Harut Baghamyan are confident that the union will become a unique organization.
“I turned to Harut, he agreed that we should all unite into a great force in order to be able to both help Armenia and preserve the Armenian identity, the Armenian language, traditions and holidays here” - Christine Movsisyan said.
Harut Baghamyan believes that the preservation of the Armenian culture in the diaspora is under threat, and the danger of assimilation is more than urgent.
There are many difficulties but he believes that together they can achieve successful results.
“The biggest challenge we face is to convince everyone that we need such an organization.
Yes, we all think differently but we want to bring a new culture of mutual respect and understanding, that is, what is lacking in Armenia and the whole world.
We, Armenians, must stop being suspicious towards each other” - Harut Baghamyan said.
Despite the fact that the official opening of the union will take place in May, active work is already underway.
They cooperate with the "Rehabilitation Center of the Defender of the Motherland" and hospitals in Armenia to provide support to wounded soldiers.
And in other communities of Israel, centers for teaching the Armenian language will soon be created.

US Congressmen condemn Azerbaijan's invasion of Armenia
Democrat Congressman, Adam Schiff, referred to Azerbaijan's invasion of Armenia's Syunik region on his Facebook:
“I am deeply disturbed by the spread of information that the Azerbaijani troops have crossed the territory of Armenia.
If this information is true, then this is another dangerous provocative action, which can lead to further life losses.
It is time for the United States to realize that our policies have encouraged the military aspirations of the Azerbaijani President, Ilham Aliyev, creating the threat of a new war.”
Adam Schiff added that he had talked to the Biden administration and urged them to be more involved in the process through the Minsk Group, as it is more important now than ever.
The congressman noted that Azerbaijan took such actions days after the decision of the US State Department to unjustifiably lift restrictions on aid to Azerbaijan.
“We should not provide military funding to a nation that normally engages in human rights abuses and violates the sovereignty of its neighboring countries,” Adam Schiff concluded.
Congressman Frank Pallone, another member of the US House of Representatives, has also expressed his concern about the issue.
The latter wrote on his Twitter page:
“Azerbaijan has now invaded the territory of Armenia, which is a clear violation of the international law.
The United States must condemn this attack and have an influence through its allies to make the Azerbaijani forces withdraw from the territory of Armenia.”
The concerns and condemnation of the US Congressmen received a wide response among other officials.
US Congressmen introduce resolution urging Azerbaijan to immediately release all Armenian POWs
The bipartisan co-chairs of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues, U.S. Representatives Adam Schiff (D-CA), Gus Bilirakis (R-FL), Frank Pallone (D-NJ), David G. Valadao (R-CA), and Jackie Speier (D-CA) introduced a resolution calling on Azerbaijan to immediately release all prisoners of war (POWs) and civilians currently detained in the aftermath of the 2020 war in Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh).
The resolution was cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 31 Members, Armenpress reports citing Congressman Adam Schiff’s website. The resolution states that “under the Geneva Conventions and the November 9, 2020 tripartite statement signed by Armenia, Russia, and Azerbaijan, all parties have an obligation to release prisoners. Armenia has fulfilled this obligation, while the Government of Azerbaijan continues to misrepresent the status of these POWs in an attempt to justify their continued captivity”.
The final part of the Resolution reads as follows:
“The House of Representatives —
-calls upon Azerbaijan to immediately return 3 all Armenian prisoners of war and captured civilians;
-urges the Secretary of State to engage at all levels with Azerbaijani authorities, including through the OSCE Minsk Group process, to make clear the importance of adhering to their obligations, under the November 9 statement and international law, to immediately release all prisoners of war and captured civilians”.
“It is unacceptable that more than 100 days after the end of the war in Nagorno-Karabakh, hundreds of Armenian service members and civilians remain in Azerbaijani custody, where little is known of their condition, treatment, or well-being,” said Rep. Schiff.
“Azerbaijan has an obligation to release these prisoners immediately – the longer the delay, the more it demonstrates their disregard for human rights and international law.

What happened on February 25?
On February 25 the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Armenia made a statement, considering the dismissal of the First Deputy Chief of the General Staff to be unjustified, and demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister and the Government of the Republic of Armenia.
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan considered this statement an attempt of a military coup and called on all his supporters to gather in Republic Square.
The Prime Minister then announced live on Facebook that the most important task was to keep the power of the people.
“You know that we are in a rather difficult situation. Yesterday and today I made a decision to dismiss the first Deputy Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, that is, I had already signed the documents on their resignation when the General Staff made a statement demanding my resignation.
What is the reason for such a statement by them?
This is what I want to talk about on Republic Square” - Pashinyan said.
After this statement by the Prime Minister, many citizens gathered in the square.
Pashinyan left the government building and met with citizens after which he told reporters that there could be political debates but not civil clashes.
Then, a march led by the Prime Minister was organized along the central streets of Yerevan.
A number of ministers and deputies of the “My Step” faction of the National Assembly took part in it.
During the march, Nikol Pashinyan and his supporters greeted the rest of the citizens with applause, regardless of whether they  supported the opposition or the government.
The Prime Minister's march ended at Republic Square where he delivered a speech at 16:00.
Nikol Pashinyan ordered all servicemen, officers and generals of the Armed Forces to continue fulfilling their duty and preserving the territorial integrity of the RA borders.
“Yes, some people tried to involve our army, our armed forces in an anti-national and anti-constitutional process.
And today I considered the statement of the General Staff an attempt of a military coup, and the people will not allow this to happen in the Republic of Armenia” - the Prime Minister said.
He noted that either the president must sign the documents on the dismissal of Onik Gasparyan, or Onik Gasparyan must resign.
Pashinyan also commented on the demands for his resignation, noting that, despite the fact he had thought a lot about that, only the people must make the decision on his dismissal, since he had been chosen by the people.
He also spoke about possible elections, noting that the decision should be made by the people as well.
He also said that the issue could be resolved through consultations.
“Our will, our unity, our determination will not yield to the corrupt regime; this is the end of the “velvet” - Pashinyan said at the end, urging the opposition to stop all protests.
After the meeting, a march was organized again.
