The first mass immigration in the 20th century was by people from Indonesia, who came to Amsterdam after the independence of the Dutch East Indies in the 1940s and 1950s. 
Today, people of non-Western origin make up approximately one-third of the population of Amsterdam, and more than 50% of the city's children. 
The next largest religion was Islam (14%), most of whose followers were Sunni. 
With 176 different nationalities, Amsterdam is home to one of the widest varieties of nationalities of any city in the world. 
Amsterdam has a rich architectural history. 
It is also one of the few examples of Gothic architecture in Amsterdam. 
A notable feature of the façades of buildings designed in Amsterdamse School is that they are highly decorated and ornate, with oddly shaped windows and doors. 
The old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century.

A total of 15 statues and 15 busts were discovered in 1983 and 1985 in two underground caches, created about 200 years apart. 
They were nevertheless designed to stand up, probably anchored to the floor in enclosed areas and intended to be seen only from the front. 
The way the statues were made would not have permitted them to last long, and since they were buried in pristine condition it is possible that they were never on display for any extended period of time, but rather produced for the purpose of intentional burial. 
Excavation began in 1982. 
The statues were discovered in 1983. 
The pit where the statues were found was carefully dug around, and the contents were placed in a wooden box filled with polyurethane foam for protection during shipping. 
The first set of statues discovered at the site was sent to the Royal Archaeological Institute in Great Britain, while the second set, found a few years later, were sent to the Smithsonian Institution in New York for restoration work. 
The statues were returned to Jordan after their conservation and can be seen in the Jordan Museum.

In 1101, when the Crusade under Raymond IV of Toulouse arrived, the city had been under Danishmend control for some time. 
Byzantine rule did not last long, and the city was captured by the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum at some unknown point; in 1127, it returned to Danishmend control until 1143, when the Seljuks of Rum retook it. 
After the Battle of Köse Dağ in 1243, in which the Mongols defeated the Seljuks, most of Anatolia became part of the dominion of the Mongols. 
Taking advantage of Seljuk decline, a semi-religious cast of craftsmen and trade people named Ahiler chose Angora as their independent city-state in 1290.

Modern English has spread around the world since the 17th century as a consequence of the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States. 
Through all types of printed and electronic media in these countries, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science, navigation, and law. 
Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspects and moods, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives, and some negation.

In May 2011, a statue of Andranik was erected in Volonka village near Sochi, Russia; however, it was removed the same day, apparently under pressure from Turkey, which earlier announced that they would boycott the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics if the statue remained standing. 
The first statue of Andranik in Armenia was erected in 1967 in the village of Ujan. 
More statues have been erected after Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991; three of which can be found in the Armenian capital of Yerevan—in Malatia-Sebastia district (2000); near the St. Gregory Cathedral (by Ara Shiraz, 2002); and outside the Fedayi Movement Museum (2006) in the Armenian capital Yerevan. 
Elsewhere in Armenia, Andranik's statues stand in Voskevan and Navur villages of Tavush, in Gyumri's Victory Park (1994), Arteni, and Angeghakot, among other places. 
Sero Khanzadyan's novel Andranik was suppressed for years and was published in 1989 when the tight Soviet control over publications was relaxed. 
It was first published in Yerevan in 2008. 
In 1913, Leon Trotsky described Andranik as "a hero of song and legend." 
Andranik's medals and sword were moved to Armenia and given to the History Museum of Armenia in 2006.

In 1864, Dvořák agreed to share the rent of a flat located in Prague's Žižkov district with five other people, who also included violinist Mořic Anger and Karel Čech, who later became a singer. 
In the early 1860s, Dvořák also made his first symphonic attempts, some of which he self-critically burned. 
For example, the Third String Quartet, B.18, was written in about 1869 but first published posthumously in 1964 and premiered in 1969. 
The first press mention of Antonín Dvořák appeared in the Hudební listy journal in June 1871, and the first publicly performed composition was the song Vzpomínání ("Reminiscence", October 1871, musical evenings of L. Procházka). 
Its overture was premiered in 1872 in a Philharmonic concert conducted by Bedřich Smetana, but the full opera with the original score was performed once in 1929. 
In March 1873, his Czech patriotic cantata The Heirs of the White Mountain was performed by the Prague Hlahol Choral Society of 300 singers (conducted by his friend and supporter Karel Bendl) to a warm response from both audience and critics. 
The two symphonies were Dvořák's third and fourth, both of which had been premiered in Prague in the spring of 1874. 
Clapham gives the official report for the 1874 prize, saying Dvořák was a relatively impoverished music teacher who "has submitted 15 compositions, among them symphonies, which display an undoubted talent...The applicant... deserves a grant to ease his straitened circumstances and free him from anxiety in his creative work." 
The dances were played in 1879 in concerts in France, England, and the United States. 
Many of Dvořák's compositions, such as the Slavonic Dances and his large collection of songs, were directly inspired by Czech, Moravian, and other Slavic traditional music. 
At the time of its first performance, he claimed that he used elements from American music such as spirituals and Native American music in this work, but he later denied this. 
The first four of poems are based upon ballads from the collection Kytice by the Czech folklorist Karel Jaromír Erben. 
It was composed in 1892 and dedicated to the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. 
The concerto was premiered in 1883 in Prague by the violinist František Ondříček, who also gave its first performances in Vienna and London. 
If this nationalist sentiment was at the heart of his opera compositions, he struggled to find a style straddling Czech traditional melody and the grand opera style of Giacomo Meyerbeer, which he experienced as lead viola player in the orchestra of Prague's Provisional Theatre between 1862 and 1871, and whose influence is evident in his works such as Vanda and Dimitrij. 
The resulting work, considered the finest of his song cycles, is based on the text of the Czech Bible of Kralice. 
Dvořák created many other songs inspired by Czech national traditional music, such as the "Love Songs", "Evening Songs", etc. 
It was created for piano duet (one piano, four hands), but Dvořák then orchestrated the entire set, completing it the same year. 
In the wake of the arrest of Socialist Party leaders that followed revolutionary riots in August 1917, Gramsci became one of Turin's leading socialists.

Fr Halemba's Missionary service of was not confined to pastoral activities alone, but also covered many other areas. 
He had to struggle with difficulties such as malnutrition, a malaria epidemic, lack of antibiotics and vaccines, high perinatal mortality - with the nearest hospital about 80 km away, it was not always possible to bring the patient there on time. 
Thanks to the administrative assistance of Bishop Adolf Fürstenberg, the financial support of benefactors and the commitment of the local people who contributed with their labour, the hospital in Mambwe was finished in two years. 
Fr Halemba contributed also to the creation of the first kindergarten and the first high school in the Mambwe Mission. 
The Mambwe people were the first of 72 local tribes to accept Catholic missionaries. 
This is also where the first Christian settlement and school were established. 
However, until that time, the Mambwe people did not have a good translation of the New Testament in their mother tongue. 
They were reluctant to use the existing Protestant translation from the late nineteenth century with numerous borrowings derived from Swahili, outdated linguistic forms, and lots of grammatical inconsistencies. 
Therefore, a new, more understandable translation was needed, especially for the younger generation. 
Fr Halemba, assisted by a group of local consultants, took up the challenge and translated the New Testament into the language of the Mambwe people in just two years. 
Polish missionaries from Fidei Donum printed it out as a gift on the occasion of the jubilee of the centenary of the Catholic Church in Zambia in 1991. 
In 2007, he released two important publications: the English-Mambwe Dictionary, based on the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary and containing 21,300 entries, as well as a grammar of the Mambwe language. 
In addition, Fr Halemba edited and published the work of the African missionary, White Father Marcel Petitclair, the Roman Missal in the Mambwe language. 
In 2009, Fr Halemba contributed to the publication of the Bible for children in Mambwe: "God speaks to His Children", and compiled and completed a three-volume liturgical guide for catechists ("Mambwe Liturgical Lectionaries A, B and C"), also initiated by Fr Marcel Petitclair M. Afr. 
In 1996, he became the director of the Missionary Formation Centre in Warsaw and the secretary of the Polish Episcopate Commission for Missions, and in 1999 he was additionally nominated as Polish Bishops’ Conference Delegate for Missionary Affairs. 
During his pastoral and missionary journeys, he has collected many souvenirs such as objects for everyday use, works of art (mainly African, but also Indian and Papuan) and objects of worship. 
He returns to Zambia every year and organises the annual meeting of Polish missionaries in Lusaka for years, as well as the Mambwe Cultural Contest - a festival of the traditional language: oratory art, narration of folk tales, poetry, song and dance. 
From 2006 to 2010, he was responsible for helping English and Portuguese-speaking African countries. 
During the genocide of Christians in the Middle East, he hurried to the rescue of the Church affected by war and persecution, especially in Iraq and Syria. 
He is the author of the "Return to the Roots" program (Marshall Plan for the Nineveh Plains), which obtained international financial support and enabled the reconstruction of private homes and the infrastructure of the Church in Iraq. 
Thanks to this initiative, nearly half of the expelled Christian families could return to their homes. 
All of these humanitarian actions, diplomatic activities and advocacy for peace have helped to maintain the presence of Christians in their native lands, the cradle of Christian faith in the Middle East. 
As a scientist, Fr Halemba conducts research documenting the persecution and genocide of Christians in the Middle East, as well as sociological and ethnographic research.

In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, contemporaries of al-Baghdadi describes him in his youth as being shy, unimpressive, a religious scholar, and a man who eschewed violence. 
Ahmed al-Dabash, the leader of the Islamic Army of Iraq and a contemporary of al-Baghdadi who fought against the allied invasion in 2003, gave a description of al-Baghdadi that matched that of the Tobchi residents: I was with Baghdadi at the Islamic University. 
He was quiet and retiring. 
Shortly thereafter, in retaliation for bin Laden's death, ISI pledged on its website to carry out 100 attacks across Iraq featuring various methods of attack, including raids, suicide attacks, roadside bombs and small arms attacks in all cities and rural areas across the country. 
Officials claimed that they had also seized a list containing the names and locations of other al-Qaeda operatives. 
In an interview with Al Jazeera on 7 December 2012, Iraq's Acting Interior Minister said that the arrested man was not al-Baghdadi, but rather a sectional commander in charge of an area stretching from the northern outskirts of Baghdad to Taji. 
Al-Baghdadi remained leader of the ISI until its formal expansion into Syria in 2013 when, in a statement on 8 April 2013, he announced the formation of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL); alternatively translated from Arabic as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). 
In January 2014, ISIL expelled Jabhat al-Nusra from the Syrian city of Raqqa, and in the same month clashes between the two in Syria's Deir ez-Zor Governorate killed hundreds of fighters and displaced tens of thousands of civilians. 
The declaration of a caliphate was heavily criticized by Middle Eastern governments, other jihadist groups, and Sunni Muslim theologians and historians. 
According to tradition, if a caliph fails to meet any of these obligations at any period, he is required by the law to abdicate his position and the community has to appoint a new caliph, theoretically selected from throughout the caliphdom as being the most religiously and spiritually pious individual among them. 
He said that he would conquer both Rome and Spain in this endeavor and urged Muslims across the world to immigrate to the new Islamic State. 
According to a report in October 2014, after suffering serious injuries, al-Baghdadi fled IS's capital city Raqqa due to the intense bombing campaign launched by Coalition forces, and sought refuge in the Iraqi city of Mosul, the largest city under IS control at the time. 
Other indications of the decline of secularism were the destruction of secular institutions and its replacement with strict sharia law, and the gradual caliphization and Sunnification of regions under the group's control. 
He calls for attacks to be mounted in Saudi Arabia, describing Saudi leaders as "the head of the snake", and also says that the US-led military campaign in Syria and Iraq was failing. 
He also condemns the Saudi involvement in Yemen, and claims that the conflict will lead to the end of the Saudi royal family's rule. 
He further claims that Islam was never a religion of peace but instead is "the religion of fighting". 
The US Department of State's Rewards for Justice Program identified Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as a senior leader of the IS terrorist organization, and as having been "responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians in the Middle East, including the brutal murder of numerous civilian hostages from Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States." 
The US Department of Defense said that al-Baghdadi had not been the target of the airstrikes, and "we have no reason to believe it was Baghdadi." 
It was also reported that a spinal injury which had left him paralyzed meant that he might never be able to fully resume direct command of IS. 
However, the Russian Foreign Ministry told Rudaw they did not have knowledge of the news and were not aware of his arrest. 
The US Department of Defense stated it was trying to confirm the new reports of his death. 
Her father, Ibrahim Dulaimi, an IS emir in Syria, was reportedly killed in September 2013 during an operation against the Syrian Army in Deir Attiyeh. 
The Iraq Interior Ministry has said that her brother is facing execution in Iraq for a series of bombings in southern Iraq. 
The Iraq government, however, said that al-Dulaimi is the daughter of an active member of al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, al-Nusra Front. 
An unnamed intelligence source told The New York Times that during the Iraq war, when the Americans captured a wife of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, "We got little out of her, and when we sent her back, Zarqawi killed her." 
Other sources identify her first husband as Fallah Ismail Jassem, a member of the Rashideen Army, who was killed in a battle with the Iraqi Army in 2010. 
On 9 December 2014, al-Dulaimi and her current Palestinian husband, Kamal Khalaf, were formally arrested after the Lebanese Military Court issued warrants and filed charges for belonging to a terrorist group, holding contacts with terrorist organizations, and planning to carry out terrorist acts.

Set in a kingdom of lions in Africa, The Lion King tells the story of Simba (Swahili for lion), a lion cub who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as King of the Pride Lands; however, after his paternal uncle Scar kills Mufasa to seize the throne, Simba is tricked into believing he was responsible for his father's death and flees into exile. 
After Simba grows into a cub, Mufasa shows him the Pride Lands and explains the responsibilities of kingship and the "circle of life," which connects all living things. 
Though disappointed with Simba for disobeying him and putting himself and Nala in danger, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. 
Scar, having planned the attack, visits the hyenas and convinces them to help him kill both Mufasa and Simba in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands. 
Scar tricks Simba into believing that the event was his fault and tells him to leave the kingdom and never return.

The Gallery has an inner courtyard and a wooden balcony and its style is typical of the 19th century urban architecture in Alexandrapol, which is a fusion of European and traditional Armenian architectural elements of that time. 
During the Soviet period, the city was the administrative center of the Askeran District, which was a part of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast in the Azerbaijan SSR. In 1991, it became the center of the Askeran Province of the Republic of Artsakh following the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. 
The city is home to factories producing wine, brandy and non-alcoholic drinks, as well as architectural enterprises, secondary and musical schools, a house of culture, a municipal building, a kindergarten, and a hospital. 
The purpose of the restoration is to preserve the monument, as well as making the place of interest for tourists. 
On 22 February, two days after the request of Karabakh National Council to transfer the region of Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia, a crowd of Azerbaijanis surrounded the local Communist Party headquarters, demanding information about rumors of an Azerbaijani having been killed in Stepanakert.

Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. 
In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size and distance of the Moon and Sun, and he proposed a model of the Solar System where the Earth and planets rotated around the Sun, now called the heliocentric model. 
Research in astrobiology comprises three main areas: the study of habitable environments in the Solar System and beyond, the search for planetary biosignatures of past or present extraterrestrial life, and the study of the origin and early evolution of life on Earth. 
Very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would be tidally locked to the star. 
The problem with the formula is that it is not used to generate or support hypotheses because it contains factors that can never be verified. 
Another associated topic is the Fermi paradox, which suggests that if intelligent life is common in the universe, then there should be obvious signs of it. 
Biologists have found extremophiles that thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, alkali, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and in a range of other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life. 
This event led to an increase in the study of the potential for life on other planets, as scientists began to consider the possibilities opened up by the new technology of space exploration. 
Characterization of these organisms, their environments and their evolutionary pathways, is considered a crucial component to understanding how life might evolve elsewhere in the universe. 
Emerging astrobiological research concerning the study of the origin and early evolution of life on Earth utilises methodologies within the palaeosciences. 
The alternative hypothesis of panspermia is that the first elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth. 
The study of microbial fossils: Scientists are investigating the presence of microbial fossils in ancient rocks, which can provide clues about the early evolution of life on Earth and the emergence of the first organisms. 
Liquid water: Liquid water is a common molecule that provides an excellent environment for the formation of complicated carbon-based molecules, and is generally considered necessary for life as we know it to exist. 
The principle of mediocrity suggests that life on Earth is not exceptional, and it is more than likely to be found on innumerable other worlds. 
Research into the environmental limits of life and the workings of extreme ecosystems is ongoing, enabling researchers to better predict what planetary environments might be most likely to harbor life.

The Kingdom of Asturias transitioned into the Kingdom of León in 925, when Fruela II of Asturias became king with his royal court in León. 
The kingdom originated in the western and central territory of the Cantabrian Mountains, particularly the Picos de Europa and the central area of Asturias. 
The main political and military events during the first decades of the kingdom's existence took place in the region. 
According to the descriptions of Strabo, Cassius Dio and other Graeco-Roman geographers, several peoples of Celtic origin inhabited the lands of Asturias at the beginning of the Christian era, most notably: in the Cantabri, the Vadinienses, who inhabited the Picos de Europa region and whose settlement gradually expanded southward during the first centuries of the modern era the Orgenomesci, who dwelled along the Asturian eastern coast in the Astures, the Saelini, whose settlement extended through the Sella Valley the Luggones, who had their capital in Lucus Asturum and whose territories stretched between the Sella and Nalón the Astures (in the strictest sense), who dwelled in inner Asturias, between the current councils of Piloña and Cangas del Narcea the Paesici, who had settled along the coast of Western Asturias, between the mouth of the Navia river and the modern city of Gijón Classical geographers give conflicting views of the ethnic description of the above-mentioned peoples. 
Ptolemy says that the Astures extended along the central area of current Asturias, between the Navia and Sella rivers, fixing the latter river as the boundary with the Cantabrian territory. 
In any case, ethnic borders in the Cantabrian Mountains were not so important after that time, as the clan divisions that permeated the pre-Roman societies of all the peoples of Northern Iberia faded under similar political administrative culture imposed on them by the Romans. 
The situation started to change during the Late Roman Empire and the early Middle Ages, when an Asturian identity gradually started to develop: the centuries-old fight between Visigothic and Suebian nobles may have helped to forge a distinct identity among the peoples of the Cantabrian districts. 
The gradual formation of Asturian identity led to the creation of the Kingdom of Asturias after Pelagius' coronation and the victory over the Muslim garrisons in Covadonga in the early 8th century. 
After the first incursion of Tarik, who reached Toledo in 711, the Yemeni viceroy of Ifriqiya, Musa bin Nusayr, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar the following year and carried out a massive operation of conquest that would lead to the capture of Mérida, Toledo, Zaragoza and Lerida, among other cities. 
During the last phase of his military campaign, he reached the northwest of the Peninsula, where he gained control of the localities of Astorga and Gijón. 
After receiving word of the arrival of the Muslims, Pelayo and his companions hurriedly crossed the Piloña and headed toward the narrow, easily defended valley of Mt. Auseva, taking refuge in one of its caves, Covadonga. 
He then married his daughter, Ermesinda, to Alfonso, the son of Peter of Cantabria, the leading noble at the still-independent Visigothic duchy of Cantabria. 
After Pelayo's victory over the Moorish detachment at the Battle of Covadonga, a small territorial independent entity was established in the Asturian mountains that was the origin of the kingdom of Asturias. 
During the first decades, the Asturian dominion over the different areas of the kingdom was still lax and so it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. 
Alfonso's son Fruela married Munia, a Basque princess from Alava, while his daughter Adosinda married Silo, a local chief from the area of Flavionavia, Pravia. 
Alfonso II was elected king after Silo's death, but Mauregato organized a strong opposition and forced the new king to withdraw to lands in Alava 
It continued under that name until incorporated into the Kingdom of Castile in 1230, after Ferdinand III became joint king of the two kingdoms.

The decisive victory thwarted the campaign of the Kingdom of Italy to expand its colonial empire in the Horn of Africa. 
A dispute later arose over the interpretation of the two versions of the document. 
The Italian-language version of the disputed Article 17 of the treaty stated that the Emperor of Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian authorities, effectively making Ethiopia a protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy. 
The Amharic version of the article, however, stated that the Emperor could use the good offices of the Kingdom of Italy in his relations with foreign nations if he wished. 
However, the Italian diplomats claimed that the original Amharic text included the clause and that Menelik II knowingly signed a modified copy of the Treaty.

The region stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Arabian Sea in the east, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north to the Indian Ocean in the southeast. 
Arab nationalism arose in the second half of the 19th century along with other nationalist movements within the Ottoman Empire. 
"No universally accepted definition of 'the Arab world' exists, but it is generally assumed to include the twenty-two countries belonging to the Arab League that have a combined population of about 400 million (Seib 2005, 604).
Arab Muslims first attacked Sasanian territory in 633, when Khalid ibn al-Walid invaded Mesopotamia (then known as the Sasanian province of Asōristān; roughly corresponding to modern-day Iraq), which was the political and economic centre of the Sasanian state. 
Following the transfer of Khalid to the Byzantine front in the Levant, the Muslims eventually lost their holdings to Sasanian counterattacks. 
Some Iranian historians have defended their forebears using Arab sources to illustrate that "contrary to the claims of some historians, Iranians, in fact, fought long and hard against the invading Arabs." 
When Western academics first investigated the Muslim conquest of Persia, they relied solely on the accounts of the Armenian Christian bishop Sebeos, and accounts in Arabic written some time after the events they describe. 
It is now widely believed that the annexation of the Lakhmid kingdom was one of the main factors behind the fall of the Sasanian Empire and the subsequent Islamic conquest of Persia. 
Before attacking Ctesiphon, Khalid decided to eliminate all Persian forces in the south and west. 
He accordingly marched against the border city of Firaz, where he defeated the combined forces of the Sasanian Persians, the Byzantines and Christian Arabs in December. 
According to the will of Abu Bakr, Umar was to continue the conquest of Syria and Mesopotamia. 
With the Byzantine threat ended, the Sasanian Empire was still a formidable power with vast manpower reserves, and the Arabs soon found themselves confronting a huge Persian army with troops drawn from every corner of the empire, including war elephants, and commanded by its foremost generals. 
After the conquest of Khuzistan, Umar wanted peace. 
The Muslim Conquest of Persia. 
Sustained street demonstrations took place in Morocco, Iraq, Algeria, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman and Sudan.

The larger Crown of Aragon must not be confused with one of its constituent parts, the Kingdom of Aragon, from which it takes its name. 
In 1479, a new dynastic union of the Crown of Aragon with the Crown of Castile by the Catholic Monarchs, joining what contemporaries referred to as "the Spains. 
The Crown of Aragon eventually included the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia (until the 12th century the County of Barcelona and others), the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, the Kingdom of Sicily, Malta, the Kingdom of Naples and Kingdom of Sardinia. 
In the Late Middle Ages, the southward territorial expansion of the Aragonese Crown in the Iberian Peninsula stopped in Murcia, which eventually consolidated as a realm of the Crown of Castile, the Kingdom of Murcia. 
Mercenaries from the territories in the Crown, known as Almogavars participated in the creation of this Mediterranean empire, and later found employment in countries all across southern Europe. 
In January 1266, James I besieged and captured Murcia, then settled his own men, mostly Catalans, there; and handed Murcia over to Castile with the treaty of Cazorla. 
When Peter III refused to impose the Charters of Aragon in Valencia, the nobles and towns united in Zaragoza to demand a confirmation of their privileges, which the king had to accept in 1283. 
The fact that the King was keen on settling new kingdoms instead of merely expanding the existing kingdoms was a part of a power struggle that pitted the interests of the king against those of the existing nobility. 
Thus, the new territories gained from the Moors—namely Valencia and Majorca—were given furs as an instrument of self-government in order to limit the power of nobility in these new acquisitions and, at the same time, increase their allegiance to the monarchy itself. 
The literary evocation of past splendour recalls correctly the great age of the 13th and 14th centuries, when Majorca, Valencia and Sicily were conquered, the population growth could be handled without social conflict, and the urban prosperity, which peaked in 1345, created the institutional and cultural achievements of the Crown. 
It was unable to prevent the loss of Roussillon in 1659, the loss of Minorca and its Italian domains in 1707–1716, and the imposition of French language on Roussillon 
The reprisals inflicted on the territories that had fought against Philip V in the War of Succession is given by some Valencian nationalists and Catalan nationalists as an argument against the centralism of Spanish nationalism and in favor of federalism, confederation, or even independence. 
The Romanticism of the 19th century Catalan Renaixença movement evoked a "Pyrenean realm" that corresponded more to the vision of 13th century troubadours than to the historical reality of the Crown. 
James III of Majorca, vassal of the Kingdom of Aragon, used a coat of arms with four bars, as seen on the Leges palatinae miniatures.

Aram Yerganian was born in Erzurum on 20 May 1900. 
He was the third child of Sarkis Yerganian and Mariam Soghoyan-Yerganian. 
After the victory over the Ottoman forces and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Armenia in 1918, Yerganian enlisted in Operation Nemesis, the covert operation led by a special body of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation aimed at assassinating all key organizers of massacres against Armenians both in the Ottoman Empire and in Azerbaijan. 
After his action in Germany, Yerganian went to Austria and then to Bucharest, where he lived until he moved to Buenos Aires in 1927. 
While following the established musical traditions of Russia, he broadly incorporated Armenian and, to lesser extent, Caucasian, Eastern and Central European, and Middle Eastern peoples' folk music in his works.

In 1925, Mikhail Gnessin started a composition class at the institute, which Khachaturian joined. 
In 1939 he made a six-month trip to his native Armenia "to make a thorough study of Armenian musical folklore and to collect folk-song and dance tunes" for his first ballet, Happiness which he completed in the same year. 
In 1944, Khachaturian composed the largely symbolic Anthem of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. 
In mid-December 1947, the Department for Agitation and Propaganda (better known as Agitprop) submitted to Andrei Zhdanov, the secretary of the Communist Party's Central Committee, a document on the "shortcomings" in the development of Soviet music. 
In retrospect, it was most likely Khachaturian's administrative role in the Union [of Soviet Composers], perceived by the government as a bastion of politically incorrect music, and not his music as such, which earned him a place on the black list of 1948." 
During his career as a university professor, Khachaturian emphasized the role of folk music to his students and instilled the idea that composers should master their nations' folk music heritage. 
In 1950, he began working on his third and last ballet, Spartacus (1950–54), which later proved to be his last internationally acclaimed work. 
He served as the President of the Soviet Association of Friendship and Cultural Cooperation with Latin American States from 1958 and was a member of the Soviet Peace Committee (since 1962). 
Despite his formal restoration after the 1948 denunciation, Khachaturian only succeeded in composing one internationally acclaimed work in the last 30 years of his life, the ballet Spartacus. 
According to Jonathan McCollum and Andy Nercessian, his music for these two ballets "can safely be included among the best known pieces of classical music throughout the world, a fact that is vitalized by perception that these are perhaps the only works through that the world really knows Armenian music". 
The composer left his manuscripts, letters, piano, various memorabilia, and personal gifts to the institution in his will. 
The building is an extension of the house where the composer resided whenever he visited the Armenian capital.

He became engaged to Justinian's niece Praejecta, but did not marry her due to the opposition of the Empress Theodora. 
Shortly after, in a skirmish between the rebels and the Byzantine army at Oenochalacon, Artabanes may have killed the Byzantine general Sittas, sent by Justinian to quell the rebellion (Procopius supplies two accounts, one attributing Sittas's death to Artabanes and another to an otherwise unknown Armenian named Solomon). 
Artabanes's father tried to negotiate a settlement with Sittas' successor, Bouzes, but was murdered by the latter. 
Along with his brother, Artabanes was placed in command of a small Armenian contingent and sent to Africa in spring 545 under the senator Areobindus. 
There, the Byzantines were engaged in a protracted war with the rebellious Moorish tribes. 
Artabanes and his men remained loyal to Areobindus during the rebellion of the dux Numidiae Guntharic in late 545. 
Guntharic, allied with the Moorish chieftain Antalas, marched on Carthage and seized the city gates. 
Artabanes kept his plan in absolute secrecy for a long time, confiding only with his two closest Armenian friends: even his Armenian unit of hand-picked and completely loyal veteran soldiers was not aware of it until the very last moment. 
Soon afterwards, Artabanes was indeed recalled to Constantinople, replaced in Africa by John Troglita.

However, Nagorno-Karabakh and Zangezur refused to recognize the jurisdiction of the Azerbaijani Republic. 
The university was established in 1969, in Stepanakert, the centre of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. 
In the second half of the 1980s, in the beginning days of the new stage of Artsakh Armenians’ liberating movement, the university became the scientific basing epicenter of national struggle. 
In October 1992, the Government of Armenia made a decision to merge the Stepanakert branch of Vanadzor Pedagogical Institute with Stepanakert branch of Yerevan Engineering University, renaming the newly established university into Artsakh State University, ASU. 
During the independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic the university has noted significant development. 
Recent archaeological excavation conducted in the region has provided further opportunity for the museum to enrich its collection.

Passports of the Republic of Artsakh were issued based on amendments to the Constitution of Artsakh of 2006. 
An ordinary Artsakhi passport is dark red, with the Republic of Artsakh's coat of arms emblazoned in gold in the center of the front cover. 
Due to the status of the state, the passport is not legally recognized by the international community and it is used only within the borders of Artsakh and three other post-Soviet disputed states; Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transnistria as all members of the Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations have agreed to abolish visa requirements for their citizens.

In accordance with population growth, separate colonies were carved from New South Wales: South Australia in 1836, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859. 
Between 1855 and 1890, the six colonies individually gained responsible government, thus becoming elective democracies managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the British Empire. 
The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs and defence. 
On 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning, constitutional conventions and referendums, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia as a nation. 
In 1914, Australia joined the Allies in fighting the First World War, and took part in many of the major battles fought on the Western Front. 
The shock of Britain's defeat in Asia in 1942 led to a widespread belief in Australia that a Japanese invasion was imminent, and a shift from the United Kingdom to the United States as Australia's principal ally and security partner.

In 1908, a seventh point was added to symbolise the Territory of Papua, and any future territories. 
The Southern Cross is one of the most distinctive constellations visible in the Southern Hemisphere, and has been used to represent Australia since the early days of British settlement. 
Ivor Evans, one of the flag's designers, intended the Southern Cross to also refer to the four moral virtues ascribed to the four main stars by Dante: justice, prudence, temperance and fortitude. 
The number of points on the stars of the Southern Cross on the modern Australian flag differs from the original competition-winning design, in which they ranged between five and nine points each, representing their relative brightness in the night sky. 
The outer diameter of the Commonwealth Star is 3⁄20 of the flag's width, while that of the stars in the Southern Cross is 1⁄14 of the flag's width, except for Epsilon, for which the fraction is 1⁄24. 
The most popular national flag of the period was the 1831 Federation Flag, also designed by Nicholson. 
Austria is bordered by Germany to the northwest, Czech Republic to the north, Slovakia to the northeast, Hungary to the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west. 
Africa is thus the continent with the most French speakers in the world. 
In some countries it is a first language among some classes of the population, such as in Tunisia, Morocco, Mauritania and Algeria, where French is a first language among the upper classes along with Arabic (many people in the upper classes are simultaneous bilinguals in Arabic/French), but only a second language among the general population.
The music has been influenced by language, the environment, a variety of cultures, politics, and population movement, all of which are intermingled. 
Each African group evolved in a different area of the continent, which means that they ate different foods, faced different weather conditions, and came in contact with different groups than other societies did.

Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known life; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. 
There are two forms of reproduction: asexual and sexual. 
The evolution of sexual reproduction is a major puzzle for biologists. 
Sexual reproduction typically requires the sexual interaction of two specialized reproductive cells, called gametes, which contain half the number of chromosomes of normal cells and are created by meiosis, with typically a male fertilizing a female of the same species to create a fertilized zygote. 
Other ways of asexual reproduction include parthenogenesis, fragmentation and spore formation that involves only mitosis. 
Sexual reproduction is a biological process that creates a new organism by combining the genetic material of two organisms in a process that starts with meiosis, a specialized type of cell division. 
Most organisms form two different types of gametes. 
On the other hand, animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring; for these types of animals it is common for many offspring to die soon after birth, but enough individuals typically survive to maintain the population. 
However, because they rely on mutation for variations in their DNA, all members of the species have similar vulnerabilities. 
Organisms that reproduce sexually yield a smaller number of offspring, but the large amount of variation in their genes makes them less susceptible to disease. 
When food sources have been depleted, the climate becomes hostile, or individual survival is jeopardized by some other adverse change in living conditions, these organisms switch to sexual forms of reproduction. 
Venter plans to patent his experimental cells, stating that "they are pretty clearly human inventions". 
Researchers involved stated that the creation of "true synthetic biochemical life" is relatively close in reach with current technology and cheap compared to the effort needed to place man on the Moon. 
Sexual reproduction, he argued, was like purchasing fewer tickets but with a greater variety of numbers and therefore a greater chance of success. 
The lottery principle is less accepted these days because of evidence that asexual reproduction is more prevalent in unstable environments, the opposite of what it predicts. 
Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed. 
Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition, being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. 
Throughout recorded history, the rich have been able to afford a varied diet including meat, vegetables and fruit, but for poor people, meat was a luxury and the food they ate was very dull, typically comprising mainly some staple product made from rice, rye, barley, wheat, millet or maize. 
In Ancient China, rice was the staple crop in the south and wheat in the north. 
In Ancient Rome, a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans, accompanied by green vegetables but little meat, and fish was not esteemed. 
The Romans grew broad beans, peas, onions and turnips and ate the leaves of beets rather than their roots.

Afterwards, Databen Bznuni was brought to the king in chains, and according to the time punishment means he was condemned to death as a traitor, by stoning. 
However, manorial elite of Bznunis still existed and that loyal house of patriarchal orders still retained the former disobedient and the sovereign lifestyle, so Vache Mamikonyan was given a command to destroy the entire household council which was the part of conspiracy, subsequently the Bznuni possessions were confiscated and joined to the royal estates. 
Later on, as an occupied province, it had been given to Aghbianos bishop with conferring order, for the church was limited to the pagan architectural lands and with the acquisitions of confiscated domains. 
Despite the elimination of the elite tribe, the dynasty of Bznunis was able to maintain their existence in feudal order. 
Speaking about the destruction of the tribe is definitely understood the elimination of the tribal council of elders and household authorities, because the numerous members of the tribe were connected with relative and other acting ties and were coalesced around all places in the state from centuries. 
In the past, this usually referred to those who traveled from less-developed countries to major medical centers in highly developed countries for treatment unavailable at home. 
Factors that have led to the increasing popularity of medical travel include the high cost of health care, long wait times for certain procedures, the ease and affordability of international travel, and improvements in both technology and standards of care in many countries.

Since then, it has accredited hospitals and health service organizations in ten other countries. 
The different international healthcare accreditation schemes vary in quality, size, cost, intent and the skill and intensity of their marketing. 
Differences in healthcare provider standards around the world have been recognised by the World Health Organization, and in 2004 it launched the World Alliance for Patient Safety. 
This body assists hospitals and government around the world in setting patient safety policy and practices that can become particularly relevant when providing medical tourism services. 
The limited nature of litigation in various countries is a reason for accessibility of care overseas. 
While some countries currently presenting themselves as attractive medical tourism destinations provide some form of legal remedies for medical malpractice, these legal avenues may be unappealing to the medical tourist. 
For example, the illegal purchase of organs and tissues for transplantation had been methodically documented and studied in countries such as China, Pakistan, Colombia and the Philippines. 
Such proposals have raised stormy debates between employers and trade unions representing workers, with one union stating that it deplored the "shocking new approach" of offering employees overseas treatment in return for a share of the company's savings.

It is an ancient textbook on surgery almost completely devoid of magical thinking and describes in exquisite detail the examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of numerous ailments. 
The text contains a list of medical symptoms and often detailed empirical observations along with logical rules used in combining observed symptoms on the body of a patient with its diagnosis and prognosis.
The use of herbs to treat ailments would later form a large part of Ayurveda. 
Ayurveda, meaning the "complete knowledge for long life" is another medical system of India. 
According to the compendium of Charaka, the Charakasamhitā, health and disease are not predetermined and life may be prolonged by human effort.

He joined the Jewish national movement and in 1881 immigrated to Palestine, then a part of the Ottoman Empire. 
His organizational efforts and involvement with the establishment of schools and the writing of textbooks pushed the vernacularization activity into a gradually accepted movement.

Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for "his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". 
Ørsted's discovery in 1821 that a magnetic field existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current indicated that there was a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. 
The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents in the same direction are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. 
The invention in the late nineteenth century of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. 
A voltage applied to a human body causes an electric current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. 
If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. 
During the 1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar became the most important instrument in popular music.

In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. 
During the subsequent Edo period, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century. 
During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the Pax Tokugawa, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city. 
The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city. 
This prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. 
Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation.

Turkish literature during the Ottoman period, particularly Divan poetry, was heavily influenced by Persian, including the adoption of poetic meters and a great quantity of imported words. 
After the foundation of the modern state of Turkey and the script reform, the Turkish Language Association (TDK) was established in 1932 under the patronage of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, with the aim of conducting research on Turkish. 
One of the tasks of the newly established association was to initiate a language reform to replace loanwords of Arabic and Persian origin with Turkish equivalents. 
By banning the usage of imported words in the press, the association succeeded in removing several hundred foreign words from the language. 
While most of the words introduced to the language by the TDK were newly derived from Turkic roots, it also opted for reviving Old Turkish words which had not been used for centuries. 
While the generations born before the 1940s tend to use the older terms of Arabic or Persian origin, the younger generations favor new expressions. 
The past few decades have seen the continuing work of the TDK to coin new Turkish words to express new concepts and technologies as they enter the language. 
The Meskhetian Turks who live in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia as well as in several Central Asian countries, also speak an Eastern Anatolian dialect of Turkish, originating in the areas of Kars, Ardahan, and Artvin and sharing similarities with Azerbaijani, the language of Azerbaijan. 
In native Turkic words, the sounds [c], [ɟ], and [l] are in complementary distribution with [k], [ɡ], and [ɫ]; the former set occurs adjacent to front vowels and the latter adjacent to back vowels. 
The distribution of these phonemes is often unpredictable, however, in foreign borrowings and proper nouns. 
The Turkish vowel system can be considered as being three-dimensional, where vowels are characterised by how and where they are articulated focusing on three key features: front and back, rounded and unrounded and vowel height. 
Turkish is an agglutinative language and frequently uses affixes, and specifically suffixes, or endings. 
One word can have many affixes and these can also be used to create new words, such as creating a verb from a noun, or a noun from a verbal root (see the section on Word formation). 
The task of preparing the new alphabet and selecting the necessary modifications for sounds specific to Turkish was entrusted to a Language Commission composed of prominent linguists, academics, and writers.

During much of the 2nd–5th centuries of the Common Era, after the Roman defeat of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, Jews were banned from Jerusalem. 
Early Jewish texts referred to a "western wall of the Temple", but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to the outer, retaining wall called today "the Western Wall", or to the western wall of the actual Temple. 
This description stemmed from the Jewish practice of coming to the site to mourn and bemoan the destruction of the Temple and the loss of national freedom it symbolized. 
Herod's project was to create an artificial extension to the small quasi-natural plateau on which the First Temple stood, already widened in Hasmonean times during the Second Temple period, by finally transforming it into the almost rectangular, wide expanse of the Temple Mount platform visible today. 
The find confirms the description by historian Josephus Flavius, which states that construction was finished only during the reign of King Agrippa II, Herod's great-grandson. 
Just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates from the end of the Second Temple period, and is believed to have been begun by Herod the Great. 
There is some evidence that Roman emperors in the 2nd and 3rd centuries did permit them to visit the city to worship on the Mount of Olives and sometimes on the Temple Mount itself. 
When the empire started becoming Christian under Constantine I, they were given permission to enter the city once a year, on the Tisha B'Av, to lament the loss of the Temple at the wall. 
Shortly after Saladin's 1187 siege of the city, in 1193, the sultan's son and successor al-Afdal established the land adjacent to the wall as a charitable trust 
In the late 1830s a wealthy Jew named Shemarya Luria attempted to purchase houses near the Wall, but was unsuccessful, as was Jewish sage Abdullah of Bombay who tried to purchase the Western Wall in the 1850s. 
However, this set-up lasted only for a short time due to lack of funds or because of Arab resentment. 
In 1874, Mordechai Rosanes paid for the repaving of the alleyway adjacent to the wall. 
The proposed purchase was considered and approved by the Ottoman Governor of Jerusalem, Rauf Pasha, and by the Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammed Tahir Husseini. 
Even after permission was obtained from the highest secular and Muslim religious authority to proceed, the transaction was shelved after the authorities insisted that after demolishing the quarter no construction of any type could take place there, only trees could be planted to beautify the area. 
This meant that they would have no power to stop people from using the plaza for various activities, including the driving of mules, which would cause a disturbance to worshippers. 
The attempts of the Palestine Land Development Company to purchase the environs of the Western Wall for the Jews just before the outbreak of World War I also never came to fruition. 
In the first two months following the Ottoman Empire's entry into the First World War, the Turkish governor of Jerusalem, Zakey Bey, offered to sell the Moroccan Quarter, which consisted of about 25 houses, to the Jews in order to enlarge the area available to them for prayer. 
In 2014, "Lavash, the preparation, meaning and appearance of traditional bread as an expression of culture in Armenia" was inscribed in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. 
Grammar is a system of rules which governs the production and use of utterances in a given language. 
These rules apply to sound as well as meaning, and include componential subsets of rules, such as those pertaining to phonology (the organisation of phonetic sound systems), morphology (the formation and composition of words), and syntax (the formation and composition of phrases and sentences). 
In the 1960s, Jacques Derrida, for instance, further distinguished between speech and writing, by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself. 
Palaeography is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts (as signs and symbols) in language. 
The formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like psycholinguistics, which explores the representation and function of language in the mind; neurolinguistics, which studies language processing in the brain; biolinguistics, which studies the biology and evolution of language; and language acquisition, which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages. 
Before the 20th century, the term philology, first attested in 1716, was commonly used to refer to the study of language, which was then predominantly historical in focus. 
A dialect is a variety of language that is characteristic of a particular group among the language's speakers. 
The group of people who are the speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. 
Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official status as a language. 
A particular discourse becomes a language variety when it is used in this way for a particular purpose, and is referred to as a register. 
When a dialect is documented sufficiently through the linguistic description of its vocabulary and grammar, which has emerged through the consensual laws from within its community, it gains political and national recognition through a country or region's policies. 
That is the stage when a language is considered a standard variety, one whose linguistic patterns have now stabilised from within the consent of speech community participants, after sufficient evolution, improvisation, correction, growth, and, above all, codification by its speakers. 
Lexicography, closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an encyclopedia or a dictionary. 
Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. 
For instance, the meaning "cat" is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns (in oral languages), movements of the hands and face (in sign languages), and written symbols (in written languages). 
All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis. 
Sub-fields that focus on a grammatical study of language include the following:
Phonetics, the study of the physical properties of speech sound production and perception, and delves into their acoustic and articulatory properties
Phonology, the study of sounds as abstract elements in the speaker's mind that distinguish meaning (phonemes)
Morphology, the study of morphemes, or the internal structures of words and how they can be modified
Syntax, the study of how words combine to form grammatical phrases and sentences
Semantics, the study of lexical and grammatical aspects of meaning 
Pragmatics, the study of how utterances are used in communicative acts, and the role played by situational context and non-linguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning
Discourse analysis, the analysis of language use in texts (spoken, written, or signed) Stylistics, the study of linguistic factors (rhetoric, diction, stress) that place a discourse in context
Semiotics, the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication
Stylistic features include rhetoric, diction, stress, satire, irony, dialogue, and other forms of phonetic variations. 
Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature, popular fiction, news, advertisements, and other forms of communication in popular culture as well. 
The formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like psycholinguistics, which explores the representation and function of language in the mind; neurolinguistics, which studies language processing in the brain; biolinguistics, which studies the biology and evolution of language; and language acquisition, which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages. 
An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among censors, who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society. 
Historical linguistics emerged as one of the first few sub-disciplines in the field, and was most widely practised during the late 19th century. 
There was a shift of focus from historical and comparative linguistics to synchronic analysis in early 20th century. 
The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and idiolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. 
Sociolinguists research both style and discourse in language, as well as the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society. 
Developmental linguistics is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals, particularly the acquisition of language in childhood. 
Neurolinguistics is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. 
Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language. 
Language documentation complements language description, which aims to describe a language's abstract system of structures and rules in the form of a grammar or dictionary. 
He led military campaigns across Western, South, and Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Southern Russia, defeating in the process the Khans of the Golden Horde, the Mamluks of Egypt and Syria, the emerging Ottoman Empire, as well as the late Delhi Sultanate of India, becoming the most powerful ruler in the Muslim world.

It is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun. 
These simulations show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth. 
While the giant-impact theory explains many lines of evidence, some questions are still unresolved, most of which involve the Moon's composition. 
The Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System, after Io. 
Almost all maria are on the near side of the Moon, and cover 31% of the surface of the near side compared with 2% of the far side. 
The concentration of maria on the near side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side, which may have formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few tens of millions of years after the Moon's formation. 
However, since the 1960s, scientists have hypothesized that water ice may be deposited by impacting comets or possibly produced by the reaction of oxygen-rich lunar rocks, and hydrogen from solar wind, leaving traces of water which could possibly persist in cold, permanently shadowed craters at either pole on the Moon. 
The presence of usable quantities of water on the Moon is an important factor in rendering lunar habitation as a cost-effective plan; the alternative of transporting water from Earth would be prohibitively expensive. 
In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions. 
These gases either return into the regolith because of the Moon's gravity or are lost to space, either through solar radiation pressure or, if they are ionized, by being swept away by the solar wind's magnetic field. 
This is the coldest temperature in the Solar System ever measured by a spacecraft, colder even than the surface of Pluto. 
Unlike most satellites of other planets, the Moon's orbital plane is closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planet's equatorial plane. 
For example, the plane of the Moon's orbit gradually rotates once every 18.61 years, which affects other aspects of lunar motion. 
Additionally, color constancy in the visual system recalibrates the relations between the colors of an object and its surroundings, and because the surrounding sky is comparatively dark, the sunlit Moon is perceived as a bright object. 
Today, many of these claims are thought to be illusory, resulting from observation under different lighting conditions, poor astronomical seeing, or inadequate drawings. 
However, outgassing does occasionally occur and could be responsible for a minor percentage of the reported lunar transient phenomena. 
The apparent orientation of the Moon depends on its position in the sky and the hemisphere of the Earth from which it is being viewed. 
The highest elevations of the Moon's surface are located directly to the northeast, which might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the South Pole–Aitken basin. 
The ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects: the frictional coupling of water to Earth's rotation through the ocean floors the inertia of water's movement ocean basins that grow shallower near land the sloshing of water between different ocean basins. 
Hundreds of millions of years ago, the Moon would always completely cover the Sun on solar eclipses, and no annular eclipses were possible. 
reasoned that the Sun and Moon were both giant spherical rocks, and that the latter reflected the light of the former.
Although the Chinese of the Han Dynasty believed the Moon to be energy equated to qi, their 'radiating influence' theory recognized that the light of the Moon was merely a reflection of the Sun, and Jing Fang 
In the 2nd century BC, Seleucus of Seleucia correctly theorized that tides were due to the attraction of the Moon, and that their height depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun. 
In 1998, this was followed by the Lunar Prospector mission, whose instruments indicated the presence of excess hydrogen at the lunar poles, which is likely to have been caused by the presence of water ice in the upper few meters of the regolith within permanently shadowed craters. 
LCROSS completed its mission by making a planned and widely observed impact in the crater Cabeus on 9 October 2009, whereas LRO is currently in operation, obtaining precise lunar altimetry and high-resolution imagery. 
Although Luna landers scattered pennants of the Soviet Union on the Moon, and U.S. flags were symbolically planted at their landing sites by the Apollo astronauts, no nation claims ownership of any part of the Moon's surface. 
It restricts the use of the Moon to peaceful purposes, explicitly banning military installations and weapons of mass destruction. 
The planet is an oblate spheroid, meaning that the diameter across its equator is longer than the diameter measured between its poles. 
The rotation of Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5 minutes longer than that of the equatorial atmosphere.

The mind is often understood as a faculty that manifests itself in mental phenomena like sensation, perception, thinking, reasoning, memory, belief, desire, emotion and motivation. 
Psychologists such as Freud and James and computer scientists such as Turing developed influential theories about the nature of the mind. 
The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of artificial intelligence, which works closely with cybernetics and information theory to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable to or different from mental phenomena in the human mind. 
The mind is also sometimes portrayed as a stream of consciousness, where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing. 
Although memory has traditionally been a persistent theme in philosophy, the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also saw the study of memory emerge as a subject of inquiry within the paradigms of cognitive psychology. 
In recent decades, it has become one of the pillars of a new branch of science called cognitive neuroscience, a marriage between cognitive psychology and neuroscience. 
In most animals, the brain is located in the head, protected by the skull and close to the primary sensory apparatus of vision, hearing, equilibrioception, taste and olfaction. 
Understanding the relationship between the brain and the mind –the mind–body problem – is one of the central issues in the history of philosophy, a challenging problem both philosophically and scientifically. 
Descartes, who thought extensively about mind-brain relationships, found it possible to explain reflexes and other simple behaviors in mechanistic terms, although he did not believe that complex thought, especially language, could be explained by reference to the physical brain alone. 
The evolution of human intelligence refers to several theories that aim to describe how human intelligence has evolved in relation to the evolution of the human brain and the origin of language. 
Many traits of human intelligence, such as empathy, theory of mind, mourning, ritual, and the use of symbols and tools, are already apparent in great apes although in lesser sophistication than in humans. 
Dualism and monism are the two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem. 
The philosopher of cognitive science Daniel Dennett, for example, argues there is no such thing as a narrative center called the "mind", but that instead there is simply a collection of sensory inputs and outputs: different kinds of "software" running in parallel. 
Philosopher David Chalmers has argued that the third person approach to uncovering mind and consciousness is not effective, such as looking into other's brains or observing human conduct, but that a first person approach is necessary.

The organization of International Volunteer Day is generally the result of a partnership between the UN system, governments, volunteer-involving organizations and committed individuals. 
Representatives from the media or academia, foundations, the private sector, faith groups, and sports and recreational organizations are often involved too. 
It offers an opportunity for volunteer-involving organizations and individual volunteers to promote volunteerism, encourage governments to support volunteer efforts, and recognize volunteer contributions to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at local, national, and international levels. 
The purpose of the award is to recognize online volunteers’ contributions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, to showcase the many ways in which online volunteers can strengthen the capacities of organizations, and demonstrate the difference volunteers can make to peace and development projects by sharing their time, skills and expertise over the Internet. 
The goal of IVD 2014 was to highlight the contribution of volunteers in engaging people from the grassroots in decision-making processes, ultimately creating spaces for participation that lead to stronger governance, social cohesion, peace and sustainable development.

Cartesian doubt is a form of methodological skepticism associated with the writings and methodology of René Descartes (March 31, 1596–Feb 11, 1650).
Cartesian doubt is a systematic process of being skeptical about (or doubting) the truth of one's beliefs, which has become a characteristic method in philosophy.
This method of doubt was largely popularized in Western philosophy by René Descartes, who sought to doubt the truth of all beliefs in order to determine which he could be certain were true. 
In his Meditations on First Philosophy (1641), Descartes resolved to systematically doubt that any of his beliefs were true, in order to build, from the ground up, a belief system consisting of only certainly true beliefs; his end goal—or at least a major one—was to find an undoubtable basis for the sciences. 
He showed that his grounds, or reasoning, for any knowledge could just as well be false. 
Sensory experience, the primary mode of knowledge, is often erroneous and therefore must be doubted. 
In short, if there is any way a belief can be disproved, then its grounds are insufficient. 
Descartes, knowing that the context of our dreams, while possibly unbelievable, are often lifelike, hypothesized that humans can only believe that they are awake.
Descartes conceded that we live in a world that can create such ideas as dreams. 
That is, Descartes tried to doubt his own existence, but found that even his doubting showed that he existed, since he could not doubt if he did not exist.
Sensation and the perception of reality are thought to be the source of untruth and illusions, with the only reliable truths to be had in the existence of a metaphysical mind. 
Such a mind can perhaps interact with a physical body, but it does not exist in the body, nor even in the same physical plane as the body. 
The question of how mind and body interact would be a persistent difficulty for Descartes and his followers, with different Cartesians providing different answers. 
Therefore, we can see that, while mind and body are indeed separate, because they can be separated from each other, but, Descartes postulates, the mind is a whole, inseparable from itself. 
In Germany the influence of this doctrine was not relevant and followers of Cartesianism in the German-speaking border regions between these countries (e.g., the iatromathematician Yvo Gaukes from East Frisia) frequently chose to publish their works in the Netherlands. 
In France, it was very popular, and gained influence also among Jansenists such as Antoine Arnauld, though there also, as in Italy, it became opposed by the Church. 
In England, because of religious and other reasons, Cartesianism was not widely accepted.

After a petition from 50 artists requested a reform of the institution, which had previously been under Papal authority, all teaching staff were replaced and the academy was effectively nationalised. 
The project began in the late 1990s in the site of the old Peroni Brewery. 
Since 2003 the museum has also had an annex entitled MACRO Future, which comprises two refurbished buildings of 1,000 square metres each in the former slaughterhouse of Rome, several kilometers away in the Testaccio neighborhood. 
MACRO's permanent collection includes a selection of some of the most significant expressions of the Italian art scene since the 1960s, such as the group Forma 1 with the works by Carla Accardi, Antonio Sanfilippo, Achille Perilli, Piero Dorazio, Leoncillo and Ettore Colla; the Arte Povera with Mario Ceroli and Pino Pascali; the Scuola di Piazza del Popolo with Tano Festa, Mario Schifano, Titina Maselli and Mimmo Rotella. 
The gallery collects works by such artists as Giovanni Albanese, Andrea Aquilanti, Gianni Asdrubali, Domenico Bianchi, Bruno Ceccobelli, Sarah Ciracì, Enzo Cucchi, Fabrice de Nola, Gianni Dessì, Gianfranco Baruchello, Daniele Galliano, Federico Guida, Felice Levini, Fabio Mauri, Luigi Ontani, Cristiano Pintaldi, Piero Pizzi Cannella, Gioacchino Pontrelli, Sissi, Marco Tirelli. 
These included the ancient former royal residence, the Regia (8th century BC), and the Temple of Vesta (7th century BC), as well as the surrounding complex of the Vestal Virgins, all of which were rebuilt after the rise of imperial Rome. 
Other archaic shrines to the northwest, such as the Umbilicus Urbis and the Vulcanal (Shrine of Vulcan), developed into the Republic's formal Comitium (assembly area). 
The Senate House, government offices, tribunals, temples, memorials and statues gradually cluttered the area. 
Because of its location, sediments from both the flooding of the Tiber and the erosion of the surrounding hills have been raising the level of the Forum floor for centuries. 
This returned the political center to the Forum until the fall of the Western Roman Empire almost two centuries later. 
Its long dimension was oriented northwest to southeast and extended from the foot of the Capitoline Hill to that of the Velian Hill. 
Originally, the site of the Forum had been a marshy lake where waters from the surrounding hills drained. 
Because of its location, sediments from both the flooding of the Tiber and the erosion of the surrounding hills have been raising the level of the Forum floor for centuries. 
Excavated sequences of remains of paving show that sediment eroded from the surrounding hills was already raising the level in early Republican times. 
As the ground around buildings rose, residents simply paved over the debris that was too much to remove. 
Excavations in the 19th century revealed one layer on top of another. 
According to Roman historical tradition, the Forum's beginnings are connected with the alliance between Romulus, the first king of Rome controlling the Palatine Hill, and his rival, Titus Tatius, who occupied the Capitoline Hill. 
The Forum was outside the walls of the original Sabine fortress, which was entered through the Porta Saturni. 
However, to create a larger gathering place, the Senate began expanding the open area between the Comitium and the Temple of Vesta by purchasing existing private homes and removing them for public use. 
The Temple of Concord was added in the following century, possibly by the soldier and statesman Marcus Furius Camillus. 
This began the tradition of locus popularis, in which even young nobles were expected to speak to the people from the Rostra. 
First, they stood next to the senate house; during the late Roman Republic, they were placed in front of the Basilica Porcia. 
Almost two years later, Marc Antony added to the notoriety of the Rostra by publicly displaying the severed head and right hand of his enemy Cicero there. 
After Julius Caesar's death and the end of the subsequent civil war, Augustus finished his great-uncle's work, giving the Forum its final form. 
The white marble Arch of Septimius Severus was added at the northwest end of the Forum close to the foot of the Capitoline Hill and adjacent to the old, vanishing Comitium. 
It was dedicated in 203 AD to commemorate the Parthian victories of Emperor Septimius Severus and his two sons against Pescennius Niger and is one of the most visible landmarks there today. 
The Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305) was the last of the great builders of Rome's city infrastructure and he did not omit the Forum from his program. 
In the 6th century, some of the old edifices within the Forum began to be transformed into Christian churches. 
By the 8th century, the whole space was surrounded by Christian churches taking the place of abandoned and ruined temples. 
After the eighth century, the structures of the Forum were dismantled, rearranged, and used to build towers and castles within the local area. 
In the 13th century, these rearranged structures were torn down and the site became a dumping ground. 
The Roman Forum has been a source of inspiration for visual artists for centuries. 
There are also: The Forum Boarium, dedicated to the commerce of cattle, between the Palatine Hill and the river Tiber, The Forum Holitorium, dedicated to the commerce of herbs and vegetables, between the Capitoline Hill and the Servian walls, The Forum Piscarium, dedicated to the commerce of fish, between the Capitoline hill and the Tiber, in the area of the current Roman Ghetto, The Forum Suarium, dedicated to the commerce of pork, near the barracks of the cohortes urbanae in the northern part of the Campus Martius, The Forum Vinarium, dedicated to the commerce of wine, in the area now of the "quartiere" Testaccio, between Aventine Hill and the Tiber.

The protesters marched with Turkish flags, portraits of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and carried placards reading, "We all are Mustafa Kemal. We all are Turks." 
The Turkish government must redouble its efforts to protect human rights defenders and open its political climate to a range of views. 
Recent legal reforms have brought many areas of Turkish law in line with international human rights standards, but existing limitations on free speech such as Article 301 must be repealed.
Amnesty International calls on the Turkish authorities to condemn all forms of intolerance, to uphold the rights of all citizens of the Turkish Republic and to investigate the murder of Hrant Dink thoroughly and impartially, to make the findings of the investigation public – and to bring suspected perpetrators to justice in accordance with international fair trial standards.
The Turkish authorities must also take a very hard look at their own role: their failure to repeal Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code, the continuing use of this and other provisions to prosecute writers, journalists and others that dare speak out on taboo topics, and the authorities' public criticism of these voices.
[...] I think the time has now come for the government to realize that such laws have no place in a modern society.

The model is the basis for the development of many other types of individual, crew-served, and specialized firearms. 
It is generally believed, however, that if one needs to communicate one should speak and not whisper. 
The reasons for this differ; some believe that whispering merely does not allow the voice to rest and may have a dehydrating effect, while others hold that whispering can cause additional stress to the larynx. 
The two major defining characteristics of English handbells are their clappers and ability to produce overtones. 
Unlike an orchestra or choir in which each musician is responsible for one line of the texture, a handbell ensemble acts as one instrument, with each musician responsible for particular notes, sounding his or her assigned bells whenever those notes appear in the music.
To ring a handbell, the ringer moves it in such a way that the clapper strikes the inside surface of the bell, usually holding it against his or her shoulder, bell upwards, and then swinging the bell through an elliptical shape to cause the clapper to strike the casting. 
Depending on the number of bells needed for a particular piece and the number of ringers, it may be necessary for each ringer to ring more than two bells at a time or in short succession (four-in-hand). 
A significant difference between the horse skeleton and that of a human is the lack of a collarbone—the horse's forelimbs are attached to the spinal column by a powerful set of muscles, tendons, and ligaments that attach the shoulder blade to the torso. 
A horse also has no muscles in its legs below the knees and hocks, only skin, hair, bone, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and the assorted specialized tissues that make up the hoof. 
The exterior hoof wall and horn of the sole is made of keratin, the same material as a human fingernail. 
There are certain jobs that horses do very well, and no technology has yet developed to fully replace them. 
They may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas.

A mathematical proof is a deductive argument for a mathematical statement, showing that the stated assumptions logically guarantee the conclusion. 
The argument may use other previously established statements, such as theorems; but every proof can, in principle, be constructed using only certain basic or original assumptions known as axioms, along with the accepted rules of inference. 
Proofs employ logic expressed in mathematical symbols, along with natural language which usually admits some ambiguity. 
Purely formal proofs, written fully in symbolic language without the involvement of natural language, are considered in proof theory. 
The distinction between formal and informal proofs has led to much examination of current and historical mathematical practice, quasi-empiricism in mathematics, and so-called folk mathematics, oral traditions in the mainstream mathematical community or in other cultures. 
The philosophy of mathematics is concerned with the role of language and logic in proofs, and mathematics as a language. 
The legal term "probity" means authority or credibility, the power of testimony to prove facts when given by persons of reputation or status. 
The development of mathematical proof is primarily the product of ancient Greek mathematics, and one of its greatest achievements. 
In addition to theorems of geometry, such as the Pythagorean theorem, the Elements also covers number theory, including a proof that the square root of two is irrational and a proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers. 
In the 10th century CE, the Iraqi mathematician Al-Hashimi worked with numbers as such, called "lines" but not necessarily considered as measurements of geometric objects, to prove algebraic propositions concerning multiplication, division, etc., including the existence of irrational numbers. 
As practiced, a proof is expressed in natural language and is a rigorous argument intended to convince the audience of the truth of a statement. 
The standard of rigor is not absolute and has varied throughout history. 
The concept of proof is formalized in the field of mathematical logic. 
A formal proof is a sequence of formulas in a formal language, starting with an assumption, and with each subsequent formula a logical consequence of the preceding ones. 
Indeed, the field of proof theory studies formal proofs and their properties, the most famous and surprising being that almost all axiomatic systems can generate certain undecidable statements not provable within the system. 
The definition of a formal proof is intended to capture the concept of proofs as written in the practice of mathematics. 
In direct proof, the conclusion is established by logically combining the axioms, definitions, and earlier theorems. 
This proof uses the definition of even integers, the integer properties of closure under addition and multiplication, and the distributive property. 
For example, we can prove by induction that all positive integers of the form 2n − 1 are odd.

Under normal conditions the breathing depth and rate is automatically, and unconsciously, controlled by several homeostatic mechanisms which keep the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood constant. 
Keeping the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood unchanged under a wide variety of physiological circumstances, contributes significantly to tight control of the pH of the extracellular fluids (ECF). 
Breathing has other important functions. 
It is also used for reflexes such as yawning, coughing and sneezing. 
The trachea and the first portions of the main bronchi are outside the lungs. 
In humans, as in the other mammals, this is achieved primarily through the contraction of the diaphragm, but also by the contraction of the intercostal muscles which pull the rib cage upwards and outwards. 
During forceful inhalation the accessory muscles of inhalation, which connect the ribs and sternum to the cervical vertebrae and base of the skull, in many cases through an intermediary attachment to the clavicles. 
During heavy breathing (hyperpnea) as, for instance, during exercise, exhalation is brought about by relaxation of all the muscles of inhalation, (in the same way as at rest), but, in addition, the abdominal muscles, instead of being passive, now contract strongly causing the rib cage to be pulled downwards (front and sides). 
This not only decreases the size of the rib cage but also pushes the abdominal organs upwards against the diaphragm which consequently bulges deeply into the thorax. 
This external manifestation of the use of the accessory muscles of inhalation is sometimes referred to as clavicular breathing, seen especially during asthma attacks and in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
Body tissues are therefore not exposed to large swings in oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions in the blood caused by the breathing cycle, and the peripheral and central chemoreceptors measure only gradual changes in dissolved gases. 
Thus the homeostatic control of the breathing rate depends only on the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. 
The first of these sensors are the central chemoreceptors on the surface of the medulla oblongata of the brain stem which are particularly sensitive to pH as well as the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. 
The second group of sensors measure the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood. 
Together the latter are known as the peripheral chemoreceptors, and are situated in the aortic and carotid bodies. 
For example, exercise increases the production of carbon dioxide by the active muscles. 
This carbon dioxide diffuses into the venous blood and ultimately raises the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. 
The respiratory centers respond to this information by causing the rate and depth of breathing to increase to such an extent that the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood return almost immediately to the same levels as at rest. 
The respiratory centers communicate with the muscles of breathing via motor nerves, of which the phrenic nerves, which innervate the diaphragm, are probably the most important. 
Doubling the volume of the lungs halves the pressure in the lungs at any altitude. 
Having the sea level air pressure (100 kPa) results in a pressure gradient of 50 kPa but doing the same at 5500 m, where the atmospheric pressure is 50 kPa, a doubling of the volume of the lungs results in a pressure gradient of the only 25 kPa. 
In practice, because we breathe in a gentle, cyclical manner that generates pressure gradients of only 2–3 kPa, this has little effect on the actual rate of inflow into the lungs and is easily compensated for by breathing slightly deeper. 
All of the above effects of low atmospheric pressure on breathing are normally accommodated by increasing the respiratory minute volume (the volume of air breathed in — or out — per minute), and the mechanism for doing this is automatic. 
If this switch occurs relatively abruptly, the hyperventilation at high altitude will cause a severe fall in the arterial PCO2 with a consequent rise in the pH of the arterial plasma leading to respiratory alkalosis. 
On the other hand, if the switch to oxygen homeostasis is incomplete, then hypoxia may complicate the clinical picture with potentially fatal results. 
Air breathed underwater by divers is at the ambient pressure of the surrounding water and this has a complex range of physiological and biochemical implications. 
The effects of breathing gasses under pressure are further complicated by the use of one or more special gas mixtures. 
A range of breath tests can be used to diagnose diseases such as dietary intolerances. 
The second single from the album, "Stuck with Each Other", featuring Akon, was released in February 2009 in the US and May 2009 in the UK. 
The second single from the album, "Perfect Nightmare", was released in August 2010. 
The series was officially cancelled by the ABC network on May 13, 2011. 
She has also won awards from the Writers Guild of America, Producers Guild of America, and Directors Guild of America. 
The population is mainly engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. 
85% of the population live in urban areas. 
Sweden is a constitutional monarchy, and King Carl XVI Gustaf is the head of state. 
The tradition of celebrating this date began in 1916 at the Stockholm Olympic Stadium, in honor of the election of King Gustav Vasa on 6 June 1523, as this was considered the foundation of modern Sweden. 
The site has been used for military purposes since the middle of the 17th century, and the main depot of the artillery was located here for nearly 300 years. 
The museum underwent a major refurbishment and opened in new, modern premises in 1943. 
The displays show the living conditions of the soldiers, their families and the general population during both wartime and peacetime. 
They include life-size figures of soldiers of past centuries, as well as scenes of the major battles of Swedish forces, weapons, military clothes and other attributes of war. 
The trophies and flags of armies defeated by Sweden in the 17th and 18th centuries are displayed in a special room. 
The museum was founded in 1819 by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, but goes back to the collections acquired mostly through donations by the academy since its foundation. 
One of the keepers of the collections of the academy during its earlier history was Anders Sparrman, a student of Carl Linnaeus and participant in the voyages of Captain James Cook. 
Another important name in the history of the museum is the zoologist, paleontologist and archaeologist Sven Nilsson, who brought the previously disorganised zoological collections of the museum into order during his time as keeper (1828–1831) before returning to Lund as professor. 
The Swedish History Museum (Swedish: Historiska museet or Statens historiska museum) is a museum located in Stockholm, Sweden, that covers Swedish archaeology and cultural history from the Mesolithic period to present day. 
Founded in 1866, it operates as a government agency and is tasked with preserving Swedish historical items as well as making knowledge about history available to the public. 
The origin of the museum is the collections of art and historical objects gathered by Swedish monarchs since the 16th century. 
It has a number of permanent exhibitions and annually hosts special exhibitions tied to current events. 
The History Museum is part of a central museum agency called the Statens historiska museer (SHM) ("National Historical Museums"). 
During the later part of the 18th century, art and antiquities were bought by ambassadors and members of the royal family and collected at Stockholm Palace. 
In 1846–47, the museum moved from the palace to the Ridderstolpe House at Skeppsbron where it resided until 1865 and the move to Nationalmuseum. 
Swedish archaeologist Stig Welinder argues that the History Museum was in fact founded with its establishment in the Ridderstolpe House in 1847. 
The collections of the museum were exhibited on the ground floor of the recently built Nationalmuseum. 
When plans for the new Nordic Museum building were made in 1876, it was suggested that the building should also include the History Museum's collections. 
The main objective for a new and sufficiently large building for the museum was to bring order to the collections, commonly called "The Chaos" while the unpublished research papers were referred to as "the corf". 
In 1932, the Swedish government granted funds for construction of official buildings to create jobs during the depression. 
The main building, designed by Romare and Scherman 1935–1940, reflects an ambivalence between the predominant modern style of the era and the historical context given not only by the context requirements, but also the 19th century barracks and stables south of the museum designed by Fredrik Blom. 
The museum consists of four two- and three-story block-like buildings surrounding an inner courtyard, giving it the appearance of a fortress. 
The interior of the museum is spacious with room for both permanent and special exhibitions. 
The permanent displays are arranged in chronological order in rooms facing the inner courtyard, with the pre-Christian collections on the ground floor and the collections from around 800 onwards upstairs. 
The entrance hall was refurbished in 1994 to give a modern impression of a Medieval knight's hall. 
It was built in 1994 and paid for by a donation from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. 
The floor and pillars in the room are made of limestone and diabase, and the décor is made from wrought iron. 
It is one of the largest museums in Sweden with more than 10 million artefacts, registered under around 34,000 inventory numbers, and one of the largest collections of antiquities in Europe. 
In 2011, information about 480,000 of the objects in the museum were accessible through an online database. 
The large number of preserved objects made from precious metals, is due to a law that was issued in the 17th century, stating that all such finds that were 100 years or older and with no owner, were to be redeemed by the government and sent to the History museum. 
The law is still in effect. 
This original collection had dated from the 17th century to the beginning of the 20th century. 
During his visit to the museum in August 2013, the President of the Republic of Artsakh Bako Sahakyan stated that the carpet museum plays an important role in preserving our national traditions and values and also for the development of tourism. 
Immediately after the quelling of the uprising, Azerbaijani troops, along with city's Azerbaijani inhabitants, turned their wrath on Shusha' Armenian population. 
The city's churches were put to the flame, as were cultural institutions, schools, libraries, the business section, and the homes of wealthy Armenians. 
She agreed to the project due to the social message she found in the script. 
The modern Olympic Games or Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques) are the leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. 
The IOC has needed to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. 
The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis. 
The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. 
Competition was among representatives of several city-states and kingdoms of Ancient Greece. 
These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. 
The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend. 
Tradition has it that Coroebus, a cook from the city of Elis, was the first Olympic champion. 
The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an Olympiad, was used by Greeks as one of their units of time measurement. 
The Games were part of a cycle known as the Panhellenic Games, which included the Pythian Games, the Nemean Games, and the Isthmian Games. 
The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics. 
Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821. 
It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor Panagiotis Soutsos in his poem "Dialogue of the Dead", published in 1833. 
Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire. 
Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of establishing internationally rotating Olympic Games that would occur every four years. 
On the last day of the Congress, it was decided that the first Olympic Games to come under the auspices of the IOC would take place in Athens in 1896. 
The first Games held under the auspices of the IOC was hosted in the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens in 1896. 
The Greek government also provided funding, which was expected to be recouped through the sale of tickets and from the sale of the first Olympic commemorative stamp set. 
Although it was intended that the same country host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. 
The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years in the same year as their summer counterpart. 
In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttmann, determined to promote the rehabilitation of soldiers after World War II, organised a multi-sport event between several hospitals to coincide with the 1948 London Olympics. 
The first Summer Youth Games were held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010, while the inaugural Winter Games were hosted in Innsbruck, Austria, two years later. 
Territories such as Puerto Rico, Bermuda, and Hong Kong, all of which compete as separate nations despite being legally a part of another country. 
The current version of the Olympic Charter allows for the establishment of new NOCs to represent nations that qualify as "an independent State recognised by the international community". 
Consequently, the IOC did not allow the formation of NOCs for Sint Maarten and Curaçao when they gained the same constitutional status as Aruba in 2010, although the IOC had recognised the Aruban Olympic Committee in 1986. 
The Organizing Committee led by Peter Ueberroth used some of the profits to endow the LA84 Foundation to promote youth sports in Southern California, educate coaches and maintain a sports library. 
Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong positive effect on the philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. 
The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups. 
According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that was released at the time of the games, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but could attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services. 
Thus, some weeks before the 2016 Summer Olympics, The Guardian stated that the biggest threat to the future of the Olympics is that very few cities or countries want to host them. 
The Olympic Movement encompasses a large number of national and international sporting organisations and federations, recognised media partners, as well as athletes, officials, judges, and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the Olympic Charter. 
The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement (which encompasses all entities and individuals involved in the Olympic Games) with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority. 
is responsible for selecting the host city, overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games, updating and approving the Olympic sports programme, and negotiating sponsorship and broadcasting rights. 
are temporary committees responsible for the organisation of each Olympic Games. 
French and English are the official languages of the Olympic Movement. 
Under the Samaranch presidency, the office was accused of both nepotism and corruption. 
In 1998, it was reported that several IOC members had taken gifts from members of the Salt Lake City bid committee for the hosting of the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
A BBC documentary entitled Panorama: Buying the Games, which aired in August 2004, investigated the taking of bribes in the bidding process for the 2012 Summer Olympics. 
The Olympic Games have been commercialised to various degrees since the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, when a number of companies paid for advertising, including Kodak. 
Before the IOC took control of sponsorship, the NOCs had responsibility for negotiating their own contracts for sponsorship and use of the Olympic symbols. 
It was not until the retirement of IOC President Avery Brundage, in 1972, that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and the lucrative advertising markets available to them. 
As president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest. 
Members of TOP received exclusive global advertising rights for their product category, and use of the Olympic symbol, the interlocking rings, in their publications and advertisements. 
In the following decades, the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War. 
The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn enhanced the appeal of TV air time to the advertisers. 
Viewership increased exponentially from the 1960s until the end of the 20th century. 
This was due to the advent of satellites for broadcasting live television worldwide starting in 1964, and the introduction of colour television in 1968. 
With such high costs charged to broadcast the Games, the added pressure of the internet, and increased competition from cable, the television lobby demanded concessions from the IOC to boost ratings. 
Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. 
Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments. 
The Olympic Movement uses symbols to represent the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. 
These colours were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag. 
The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. 
The Olympic motto, Citius, Altius, Fortius, a Latin expression meaning "Faster, Higher, Stronger" was proposed by Pierre de Coubertin in 1894 and has been official since 1924. 
The motto was coined by Coubertin's friend, the Dominican priest Henri Didon OP, for a Paris youth gathering of 1891. 
Greece is traditionally the first nation to enter and leads the parade in order to honour the origins of the Olympics. 
Three national flags are hoisted while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of the current host country; the flag of Greece, to honour the birthplace of the Olympic Games; and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games. 
The president of the organising committee and the IOC president make their closing speeches, the Games are officially closed, and the Olympic flame is extinguished. 
Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, assisting the officials who present the medals and acting as flag-bearers. 
There are sports recognised by the IOC that are not included in the Olympic programme. 
In October and November 2004, the IOC established an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic programme and all non-Olympic recognised sports. 
The goal was to apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic programme for each celebration of the Games. 
These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport. 
Three years later, at the 117th IOC Session, the first major programme revision was performed, which resulted in the exclusion of baseball and softball from the official programme of the 2012 London Games. 
Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other sports, the 2012 programme featured just 26 sports. 
The exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. 
Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the 1936 Winter Olympics in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals. 
However, NHL players were still not allowed to play in the Olympics until 1988, because of the IOC's amateur-only policy. 
Greece, Australia, France, and United Kingdom are the only countries to be represented at every Olympic Games since their inception in 1896. 
Cambodia, Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon boycotted the Games because of the Suez Crisis; and the People's Republic of China boycotted the Games due to the participation of the Republic of China, composed of athletes coming from Taiwan. 
In 1972 and 1976 a large number of African countries threatened the IOC with a boycott to force them to ban South Africa and Rhodesia, because of their segregationist rule. 
Athletes from Taiwan did not participate again until 1984, when they returned under the name of Chinese Taipei and with a special flag and anthem. 
The United States and sixty-five other countries boycotted the Moscow Olympics in 1980 because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. 
The boycotting nations of the Eastern Bloc staged their own alternate event, the Friendship Games, in July and August. 
In August 2008, the government of Georgia called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics, set to be held in Sochi, Russia, in response to Russia's participation in the 2008 South Ossetia war. 
During the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s, communist and socialist organisations in several countries, including the United States, attempted to counter what they called the "bourgeois" Olympics with the Workers Olympics. 
Individual athletes have also used the Olympic stage to promote their own political agenda. 
At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who finished first and third in the 200 metres, performed the Black Power salute on the victory stand. 
Currently, the government of Iran has taken steps to avoid any competition between its athletes and those from Israel. 
During the Beijing games, 3,667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency. 
In 2010, the International Olympic Committee announced it would "press" these countries to enable and facilitate the participation of women for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. 
The Olympic Charter requires that an athlete be a national of the country for which they compete. 
If an athlete gains a new or second nationality, then they do not need to wait any designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation. 
This is often because they are attracted to sponsorship deals or training facilities in the other country, or the athlete might be unable to qualify from within their country of birth. 
Every gold medal must contain at least six grams of pure gold. 
The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can be presented to the International Olympic Committee for consideration. 
The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialised group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. 
After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running. 
Various geological events that followed caused the emergence of the whole region and the sea. 
The Geological Museum of Mount Olympus, located in Leptokarya, provides detailed information about the geological structure of the mountain. 
The complicated geological past of the region is obvious from the morphology of Olympus and its National Park. 
The McCormack brothers mailed 1,360 letters in seven languages to government leaders worldwide to encourage participation in the first World Hello Day. 
Beginning with a simple greeting on World Hello Day, their activities send a message to leaders, encouraging them to use communication rather than force to settle conflicts. 
Winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are among the people who have noted World Hello Day's value as an instrument for preserving peace and as an occasion that makes it possible for anyone in the world to contribute to the process of creating peace.

China is one of 17 megadiverse countries, lying in two of the world's major biogeographic realms: the Palearctic and the Indomalayan. 
Since ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by Confucianism. 
The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that calligraphy, poetry and painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. 
With the rise of Chinese nationalism and the end of the Cultural Revolution, various forms of traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival, and folk and variety art in particular have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide. 
Concepts covered within the Chinese classic texts present a wide range of thoughts and subjects including calendar, military, astrology, herbology, geography and many others. 
China has one of the oldest sporting cultures in the world. 
The construction of the museum started in 1958, and concluded in 1962.

On November 5, a small force from Corfu made a landing and captured the coastal area of Himarë without facing significant resistance, and on December 20 Greek troops improved their positions in Epirus and entered Korçë, north of Ioannina, thus cutting off its last supply route and threatening the city's northeastern flank.

Ravenna, governed by its exarch, who held civil and military authority in addition to his ecclesiastical office, was confined to the city, its port and environs as far north as the Po (bordering territory of the duke of Venice, nominally in imperial service) and south to the Marecchia River, beyond which lay the Duchy of the Pentapolis on the Adriatic. 
The exarchate was organised into a group of duchies (Rome, Venetia, Calabria, Naples, Perugia, Pentapolis, Lucania, etc.) that were mainly the coastal cities in the Italian peninsula since the Lombards held the advantage in the hinterland. 
The civil and military head of these imperial possessions, the exarch himself, was the representative at Ravenna of the emperor in Constantinople. 
The Exarchate of Ravenna was not the sole Byzantine province in Italy. 
Piedmont, Lombardy, the interior mainland of Venetia, Tuscany and the interior of Campania belonged to the Lombards, and bit by bit the Imperial representative in Italy lost all genuine power. 
These fragments of the province of Italy were almost all lost, either to the Lombards, who finally conquered Ravenna itself in 751, or by the revolt of the pope, who finally separated from the Empire on the issue of the iconoclastic reforms. 
Meanwhile, the necessity for providing for the defence of the imperial territories against the Lombards led to the formation of local militias, who at first were attached to the imperial regiments, but gradually became independent, as they were recruited entirely locally. 
During the 6th and 7th centuries, the growing menace of the Lombards and the Franks, as well as the split between Eastern and Western Christendom inspired both by iconoclastic emperors and medieval developments in Latin theology and culminating in the acrimonious rivalry between the Pope of Rome and the Patriarch of Constantinople, made the position of the exarch more and more untenable.

Taking advantage of the conciliatory policy of the leadership of the newly-proclaimed Transcaucasian Federative Republic, the Turkish military units captured the heavily fortified Castle of Kars on 25 April, thus creating a direct threat to Alexandrapol. 
Following the siege of Kars, the Ottoman Forces Command put forward new conditions to the Transcaucasian authorities, demanding the surrender of Akhalkalaki, Akhaltsikhe and Alexandrapol, as well as of Alexandropol–Julfa railway, which the Turkish troops could use to reach Tabriz and get their hands on all the Transcaucasian railroads before the end of the war against the British. 
Unwilling to wait for the end of negotiations with the Transcaucasian delegation in Batumi, the Turkish forces took Alexandropol with a quick offensive on 15 May, creating a threat of conquest for all of Eastern Armenia. 
To be able to resist the attack, commander of the Armenian Corps, commander-in-chief of the Armenian Armed Forces Tovmas Nazarbekian decided to safeguard the strategic roads to Yerevan and Tiflis. 
A part of the Armenian troops that had left Alexandropol, including some units of the 1st Division of the Armenian Corps, as well as several units within the Special Armenian Detachment, retreated towards the Ararat Plain. 
The invasion of the Turkish army put the Armenian political leadership in both Tiflis and Yerevan into a difficult situation. 
On 19 May, after invading Surmali, Turkish General Halil Kut (the uncle of Enver Pasha) declared in Batumi that "the Armenians have been defeated and must be obeyed." 
Amid a widespread panic in the Aleksandropolsky Uyezd, the Ararat Plain and Yerevan following the attack of the Turkish troops, the Yerevan city council at a session on 18 May approved mayor Tadevos Tosyan's proposal to hand over the city to the Turks with no resistance, evacuate the population and lead them to the mountains. 
By the order of Aram Manukian and with the help of as many as 1500 residents, Yerevan's defenses, especially the area near Yerablur, were fortified. 
But he not only rejected the proposal, but also encouraged the military to resist the Ottoman advance. 
In the days that followed, Manukian played a vital role in stabilizing the situation in Yerevan and the adjacent areas and tipping the scale in the Armenians' favor. 
In the morning of 19 May, he ordered the Commander of the 1st Division, Major-General Movses Silikyan' to stop the retreat of Armenian forces and avert the Turkish attack on Yerevan at any cost.

The Turks had 40 cannons at their disposal. 
During the Battle of Sardarapat, the forces of the Armenian side formed part of the Yerevan detachment, whose other units took part in the Battle of Bash-Aparan against the 9th Turkish Division. 
The Commander-in-Chief of the forces fighting in the Battle of Sardarapat was the Deputy Commander of the Yerevan detachment, Colonel Daniel Bek-Pirumyan, while Alexander Chneour was the Chief of Staff. 
Included in these forces were the 2nd Division of the Armenian Corps and several squads of the Special Armenian Detachment. 
Included in the Yerevan unit from the Special Armenian Detachment were the 1st (Colonel Yuzbashev) and 2nd (Colonel Chakhmakhchev) Infantry Regiments of Van from the 3rd Special Brigade, the 2nd Special Cavalry Regiment of Zeytun (four cavalry battalions, Colonel Salibekyan), the infantry regiments of Khnus and Karakilisa (Colonel Kazimirsi) which formed part of the military units of the 2nd Special Brigade, the Regiment of Erzincan (6 battalions, Karapet Hassan-Pashaian) of the 1st Special Brigade, as well as the 1st Special Cavalry Regiment (military starshina Pavel Zolotarev). 
On the eve of the occupation of Alexandropol, one of the tasks of the Armenian troops was the defense of railways and roads connecting Alexandropol to Yerevan and Tiflis. 
Some subdivisions from the 2nd Special Brigade composed of the infantry regiments of Khnus and Karakilisa, as well as a part of the 1st Special Brigade (the Infantry regiment of Erzincan and other units) gradually withdrew from Ani and Aragats railway stations on the left bank of Akhuryan River towards Sardarapat from 16 to 19 May. 
During the retreat, even before clashing with the main Ottoman forces, they would come under fire from the vanguard Kurdish cavalry of the 36th Division. 
The retreat of those subdivisions via the Alexandropol-Yerevan route played an essential role for the Yerevan detachment in terms of buying time and regrouping forces. 
On 16–17 May, some of the squads of the Yerevan detachment based in Sardarapat were urgently sent to Araks and Karaburun stations to resist the Ottoman advancing towards the Ararat Plain, while some others were sent to Yerevan to get ready for the battle and receive enhancement by volunteers and armaments. 
On 20 May, the vanguard Armenian troops were forced to abandon Araks and Karaburun stations, retire from the foothills of Mastara, Talin and Ashnak, basing themselves in Sardarapat. 
Some subdivisions from the 2nd Special Brigade composed of the infantry regiments of Khnus and Karakilisa, as well as a part of the 1st Special Brigade (the Infantry regiment of Erzincan and other units) gradually withdrew from Ani and Aragats railway stations on the left bank of Akhuryan River towards Sardarapat from 16 to 19 May. 
In the evening of 20 May, the retreating troops of the 1st Special Brigade – the Regiment of Erzincan and half a battalion from the Regiment of Khnus (under the command of Karapet Hassan-Pashaian) – moved deeper from Sardarapat to the village of Khznauz. 
As a result of the Turkish invasion in Alexandropol-Yerevan direction, the groups defending Surmali were in danger of being cut off from the main forces of the Yerevan detachment and surrounded by the Ottomans. 
On 19 May, the military units of the 4th Turkish Corps invaded Surmali from Bayazet, seeking to cross the Araks River and reach the rear of the Yerevan detachment. 
After showing some resistance in mountain passes and high grounds near Igdir, the Armenian units (1st and 2nd regiments of Van) had to retreat to Igdir on 20 May, where they received an order from Yerevan to cross to the left bank of Araks across the bridge of Margara, burning down the aforementioned bridges afterwards. 
The Armenian volunteers arranged the defense of the bridges, thwarting any attempt by the Turks to cross the river and attack the Armenians from the rear. 
By the order of Silikyan, some of the 3rd Special Brigade subdivisions (4th regiment of Van, under the command of Colonel Tigran Baghdasaryan) were stationed in those areas to defend the rear from the south and prevent the Ottomans from crossing the river. 
Keeping up with their attack, the Turkish forces took the Verin Kolibeklu settlement (now in the territory of the village of Aknalich) and proceeded to Ghamishlu train depot (now in the territory of the village of Zartonk), 20 km far from Yerevan. 
At the same time, more Armenian units were sent to the battleground from Yerevan. 
Included in the Armenian forces fighting in the Sardarapat Front were the 5th and 6th regiments, the Infantry Regiment of Karakilisa (Lieutenant-Colonel Areshyan) of the 2nd Special Brigade, the Partisan Infantry Regiment, the Yezidi Cavalry Battalion, the Western Armenian volunteer groups, four artillery batteries.
The Commander-in-Chief of the forces fighting in the Battle of Sardarapat was the Deputy Commander of the Yerevan detachment, Colonel Daniel Bek-Pirumyan. 
The attack was carried out by the 5th and 6th Regiments in the center, which managed to destroy the vanguard Turkish troops with support from artillery and machine guns near the Ghamishlu depot. 
Perekrestov's volunteer regiment, the squads of Igdir, Zeytun and Khnus, 1st Special Cavalry Regiment struck the Ottomans from the sides and the rear. 
The Armenian units continued their advance and took back Gechrlu, Molla Bayazet, the village of Sardarapat and the station of the same name, as well as the field lying to the right of it. 
One battalion of the 5th Armenian Regiment attacked in the direction of Kosh-Talish and liberated the villages of Ujan and Kosh by the evening. 
After suffering defeat on 22 May, the Turkish forces took advantage of the fact that the Armenians stopped pursuing them to avoid diverging from their initial objectives, and retreated towards Araks station, basing themselves on the hills nearby. 
In the days that followed, the 449 (Tulki-tapa) and 440 (Cimni Gir) high grounds north of the station had a great tactical significance for both sides. 
After winning the battle, the Igdir detachment joined the Sardarapat detachment under Daniel Bek-Pirumyan's command, while the subdivisions of the 2nd Special Regiment of Zeytun were entrusted with the defense of the bridges on Araks River. 
The Armenians' first victory in the Sardarapat Front was of crucial importance not only in terms of boosting combat readiness of the army and ensuring further victories, but also overcoming the panic among the Armenian population of the province of Yerevan and the Western Armenian refugees. 
After the first defeat in the Sardarapat Front, the Turkish command staff, seeking to succeed and make progress, adopted the tactics of weakening the rear of the Armenian troops by means of riots in villages populated by Turkic-speaking peoples. 
Such unrest was observed in the Davalu-Ghamarlu region on 22 May, the first day of the counter-offensive. 
When the Armenian population of Davalu was transferred by train to Garamlu for security reasons that day, the 4th Regiment of Van overseeing the transfer was attacked by a mob of 5,000 from Turkish and Kurdish villages nearby. 
The five-hour confrontation was especially fierce in the vicinity of the villages of Avshar and Shirazlu which the Armenian troops ultimately captured. 
Later in the day, however, the Regiment came in the village of Yuva. 
Till the end of the Battle of Sardarapat and the departure to Dilijan at the beginning of June, the 4th Regiment of Van overseeing Ghamarlu protected the rear of the Yerevan detachment from Sharur, as well as foiling the Turks' attempt to cross the Araks River. 
The initial positions of both sides remained unchanged. 
In order to conceal defeats and major losses, the Turkish command staff made up a fake story about the sinking of Turkish echelon in the Akhuryan River and disseminated it through the press. 
In the left wing, the Partisan Infantry Regiment, the remaining subdivisions of the 1st Special Cavalry Regiment, four cannons from the 2nd Battery were dispatched to the villages of Sardarapat and Molla Bayazet. 
The detachment of Igdir (1st and 2nd Regiments of Van) based themselves in the village of Kyarimarkh, while the 2nd Cavalry Regiment (Zeytun), the Regiment of Karakilisa, as well as several volunteer groups were sent to the Araks River. 
The right wing, meanwhile, was protected by forces designed for quick military manoeuvres, including the Regiment of Erzincan in Khznauz and half a company from the Squad of Khnus, as well as the Battalion of Maku in Kosh and one company from the Regiment of Karakilisa. 
A very strong grouping of enemy troops turned out to have been dispatched to Araks station, whereas the Armenian intelligence had reported that the main forces of the Turks were based at Karaburun station and in Nerkin Talin. 
In the early hours of 26 May, the reserve companies of the 5th Regiment were brought forward from the rear. 
Later in the morning of that same day, the 1st Battalion of the 5th Regiment, by the arbitrary order of Stabs-kapitan Vardan Jaghinyan, launched an unsuccessful offensive on the Cimni Gir (440) high ground and was forced to retreat to its initial positions, suffering major losses, including Jaghinyan himself. 
At the same time, the central and left wings of the main front were reinforced by the Igdir Regiment and the Patrol forces of the Partisan Regiment, brought forward from the rear. 
At the same time, the detachment of Kosh to the right of that of Khznauz was unable to overcome the resistance of Turks near the village of Nerkin Kalakut and had to stop. 
At 9 a.m. on the same day, the Armenian artillery units in the main front of Sardarapat carried out powerful strikes on the rival's positions for half an hour, suppressing fire from artillery and machine gun subdivisions from the other part of the battleground. 
Captain Pandukht's cavalry unit, meanwhile, started an offensive south of Nerkin Kalakut, overturned the resistance of Turkish forces with the help of companies from Kosh and Khznauz, then cut through the Turkish troops to the north-west of the battleground. 
During the decisive battles on 27 May, the Turks were completely defeated, forced to retire to Karaburun Station-Mount Karaburun line in a panic. 
On the night of 27–28 May, the Armenian forces moved forward and reached the Karaburun station-Mount Karmrasar line. 
Unable to resist the Armenian side's attacks after a brief engagement in Karaburun-Ashnak, the Turks began to withdraw towards the Aragats station-Kirmizlu-Verin Agdzhakala on 28 May, where they were once again thrown back to the north. 
As a result of that day's fighting, the Armenian side seized Karaburun and Aragats stations, as well as Nerkin Talin, Verin Talin and Mastara, while Armenian intelligence units reached Ani station and found out that there were no Turkish troops on their way to Ani and Aghin stations. 
The next day on 29 May, however, the Turkish forces were significantly reinforced, which enabled them to initiate a counter-offensive on Aragats station. 
By the order of General Tovmas Nazarbekian all the Armenian forces ceased attacks. 
This marked the end of the Battle of Sardarapat. 
The soldiers of the Sardarapat Front and the command staff were extremely dissatisfied with the news of the ceasefire and cessation of attacks. 
Following the signing of the Treaty of Batum on 14 June, all the Armenian units withdrew from their posts to the borderline prescribed by the agreement.

But, almost immediately, he was informed of the ongoing negotiations between the Ottoman leadership and the Armenian National Council in Tiflis and was told by Corps Commander Tovmas Nazarbekian to cease military operations in the region. 
Though members of the National Council were widely criticized for issuing this order at the time, this decision was carried out because the ammunition stores had been all but been depleted and Ottoman commanders had received fresh reinforcements. 
The nine-day Battle of Sardarapat ended with Armenia's full victory, as a result of which the rival was thrown back 50–65 km and the immediate threat to Yerevan was eliminated. 
Armenian victories at the battles of Sardarabad, Karakilise and Bash Abara, which stopped a Turkish invasion of Eastern Armenia. 
Though the terms that Armenia agreed to in the Treaty of Batum (4 June 1918) were excessively harsh, the little republic was able to hold out until the Ottomans were forced to withdraw from the region with the end of World War I in late 1918. 
The victory played an important role in the partial failure of the Turkish invasion of Eastern Armenia, as well as in securing a victorious counter-offensive in Bash-Aparan and the heroic resistance in Karakilisa. 
The Battle of Sardarapat saved the locals and Western Armenian refugees from imminent massacre. 
The victory secured at a great cost also contributed to the enhancement of the role of Yerevan-based political and social organizations, as well as of local authorities and leading figures.

Transcendentalism is a philosophical, spiritual, and literary movement that developed in the late 1820s and 1830s in the New England region of the United States. 
A core belief is in the inherent goodness of people and nature, and while society and its institutions have corrupted the purity of the individual, people are at their best when truly "self-reliant" and independent. 
Its adherents believe that individuals are capable of generating completely original insights with little attention and deference to past masters. 
Transcendentalism emerged from "English and German Romanticism, the Biblical criticism of Johann Gottfried Herder and Friedrich Schleiermacher, the skepticism of David Hume", and the transcendental philosophy of Immanuel Kant and German idealism. 
Renaissance evolved firstly in Florence and then Rome and other parts of the Italian Peninsula as the result of Renaissance humanism and a revived interest in Classical architecture.

The Story of the Last Thought is the history of a village in Anatolia that is being destroyed by the Turks. 
The main character is the Armenian Wartan Khatisian, whose son Thovma is dying. 
His last thought — the last thought of a man, the fairy tale says, is beyond time — is being told the history of his ancestors, the life of suffering of the Armenian people. 
The storyteller Meddah guides the last thought of Thovma along the life paths of his father, that lead from a small idyllic mountain village into the torture chambers of the Turkish rulers, and let him become a witness of the big pogrom against the Armenians in 1915.

During the 2010's Vaughn starred in The Dilemma (2011), The Watch (2012), and The Internship (2013). 
They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold, symbolic colours, and dramatic, impulsive and highly expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. 
Van Gogh's mother was a rigid and religious woman who emphasized the importance of family. 
Theodorus's salary as a minister was modest, but the Church also supplied the family with a house, a maid, two cooks, a gardener, a carriage and horse; his mother Anna instilled in the children a duty to uphold the family's high social position. 
He stayed there until around March 1880, which caused concern and frustration for his parents. 
He traveled to Brussels later in the year, to follow Theo's recommendation that he study with the Dutch artist Willem Roelofs, who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art – to attend the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts. 
He continued to draw, often using his neighbours as subjects. 
He quarrelled with his father, refusing to attend church, and left for The Hague. 
When Van Gogh's father discovered the details of their relationship, he put pressure on his son to abandon Sien and her two children. 
When he complained that Theo was not making enough effort to sell his paintings in Paris, his brother responded that they were too dark and not in keeping with the bright style of Impressionism. 
After much pleading from Van Gogh, Gauguin arrived in Arles on 23 October and, in November, the two painted together. 
The ear was brought to the hospital, but Rey did not attempt to reattach it as too much time had passed.

In 1909, when Nicholas Marr and Yakov Smirnov's visited Armenia's Temple of Garni for a paleontological excavation, the local residents heard stories about the Vishaps that lived in the tall mountains. 
Scientists organized the expedition, climbed the Gegham mountains, to confirm the existence Vishaps and whether they have any scientific significance or not. 
The scientists in the mountains discovered megalithic stone sculptures, which the Armenians called "Vishap", and were mostly in the form of a fish. 
The position of the cross and the writings show that in the 13th century, the Vishap was still in the upright position. 
On other Vishaps, there are waves symbolizing water, which often come out of the mouth of the bull, long-legged birds, and rare snakes. 
Three Main Types of Vishaps: Bull form (square, thick plate form, the front is mainly a bull's head and fallen down limbs image) Fish form (oval, carved in the shape of the fish, contains features unique to the fish anatomy) Fish-Bull Form (contains both of the forms). 
However, the three forms listed above are designed and carved on all sides. 
Most of the Vishap stones are found fallen down in a horizontal position, lying down.
In contrast to Germany, Romanticism in English literature had little connection with nationalism, and the Romantics were often regarded with suspicion for the sympathy many felt for the ideals of the French Revolution, whose collapse and replacement with the dictatorship of Napoleon was, as elsewhere in Europe, a shock to the movement. 
The second period, sometimes called Ultra-Romanticism, is marked by a profound influence of European themes and traditions, involving the melancholy, sadness and despair related to unobtainable love. 
Vick Vanlian (1977-2017) was a Lebanese-Armenian designer and the founder of interior design company Vick Vanlian / V World.

Vramshapuh managed through his rule to unite the two parts of Greater Armenia. 
Some linguists estimate that between 50% and 90% of them will be severely endangered or dead by the year 2100. 
This is when a language faces strong external pressure, but there are still communities of speakers who pass the language to their children. 
According to the Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages, there are four main types of causes of language endangerment: Causes that put the populations that speak the languages in physical danger, such as: War and genocide. 
Natural disasters, famine, disease. 
The National Bank of Georgia was established on the basis of the Georgian Republican Bank of the State Bank of the USSR in 1991. 
Then, by decision of the Supreme Council of Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia was established on the basis of the Soviet financial and credit structure. 
Its status is defined by the Constitution of Georgia.

Tatev played a significant role in the history of the region as a center of economic, political, spiritual and cultural activity. 
Development of the Tatev Monastery began in the 9th century when it became the seat of the bishop of Syunik. 
In 1044, armed forces of neighbouring emirates destroyed the St. Gregory Church and its surrounding buildings, which were reconstructed soon after that. 
Its influence grew further when, in 1286, the Orbelians assumed control of the monastery, Stepanos Orbelian was consecrated metropolitan and succeeded in reuniting a number of surrounding dioceses within its realm. 
During Timur lane's campaigns into Syunik (1381–1387), Tatev was looted, burnt, and dispossessed of a significant portion of its territories. 
Soon after in 1087, the church of the Holy Mother of God was added along the northern fortifications. 
This mill is one of the best preserved in Armenia and is an excellent illustration of olive presses built in the region during the Middle Ages. 
The church was first built between 836 and 848 with the order and financial support of Prince Philipé of Syunik. 
The earliest references to its foundation are described in Stepanos Orbelian's History of the Province of Syunik, where Orbelian describes the accord through which Prince Ashot, son of Prince Philipé of Syunik delineated its borders. 
Tatev Monastery has played a notable role in the advancement of cultural life of Armenia. 
In the beginning of the 1340s, following the decline of the University of Gladzor, Hovhan Vorotnetsi departed from Vayots Dzor, and arriving in Dzghook, Vorotn. 
The first included the study of humanities and social sciences, philosophy, oration, grammar, literature and history. 
Topics of instruction included Armenian literature, interpretation and analysis of the Old and New Testaments, works of the holy fathers, works of Plato, Aristotle, Philo of Alexandria and Porphyry, and their analysis. 
Its achievements appear even more significant when they are viewed in context with the turbulent political situation and endless devastations of the period, when the University was occasionally forced to migrate to avoid persecutions from invading forces. 
In spite of the dauntless efforts of its new leaders, the political and economic conditions, compounded with the security complications of the period led Tatev to lose its luster and finally ceased to function following the invasions of Shah Rukh in 1434. 
Dominant sectors of its diverse economy include defense, financial services, information technology, telecommunications, and transportation.

The palace was fully transformed into a museum on May 1, 1921, at the initiative of Georgian ethnographer and geologist Akaki Chanturia. 
The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. 
Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the Renaissance and then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly during the early development of classical mechanics. 
Other natural philosophers, notably Gottfried Leibniz, thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects, given by their distance and direction from one another. 
In the 18th century, the philosopher and theologian George Berkeley attempted to refute the "visibility of spatial depth" in his Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision. 
Later, the metaphysician Immanuel Kant said that the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones derived from experiences of the outside world—they are elements of an already given systematic framework that humans possess and use to structure all experiences. 
According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space. 
For Leibniz, then, space was an idealised abstraction from the relations between individual entities or their possible locations and therefore could not be continuous but must be discrete. 
Although people in the family are related to one another, the relations do not exist independently of the people. 
Leibniz argued that space could not exist independently of objects in the world because that implies a difference between two universes exactly alike except for the location of the material world in each universe. 
But since there would be no observational way of telling these universes apart then, according to the identity of indiscernibles, there would be no real difference between them. 
According to the principle of sufficient reason, any theory of space that implied that there could be these two possible universes must therefore be wrong. 
For a relationist there can be no real difference between inertial motion, in which the object travels with constant velocity, and non-inertial motion, in which the velocity changes with time, since all spatial measurements are relative to other objects and their motions. 
But Newton argued that since non-inertial motion generates forces, it must be absolute. 
If the bucket's spinning is stopped then the surface of the water remains concave as it continues to spin. 
The concave surface is therefore apparently not the result of relative motion between the bucket and the water. 
For several centuries the bucket argument was considered decisive in showing that space must exist independently of matter. 
In the eighteenth century the German philosopher Immanuel Kant developed a theory of knowledge in which knowledge about space can be both a priori and synthetic. 
In his work, Kant rejected the view that space must be either a substance or relation. 
One of these, the parallel postulate, has been the subject of debate among mathematicians for many centuries. 
Around 1830 though, the Hungarian János Bolyai and the Russian Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky separately published treatises on a type of geometry that does not include the parallel postulate. 
Consequently, the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180° and the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is greater than pi. 
With a suitable falloff in temperature, if the scientists try to use measuring rods to determine the sum of the angles in a triangle, they can be deceived into thinking that they inhabit a plane, rather than a spherical surface. 
In fact, the scientists cannot in principle determine whether they inhabit a plane or sphere and, Poincaré argued, the same is true for the debate over whether real space is Euclidean or not. 
In this theory, the speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers—which has the result that two events that appear simultaneous to one particular observer will not be simultaneous to another observer if the observers are moving with respect to one another. 
Instead of viewing gravity as a force field acting in spacetime, Einstein suggested that it modifies the geometric structure of spacetime itself. 
According to the general theory, time goes more slowly at places with lower gravitational potentials and rays of light bend in the presence of a gravitational field. 
On the other hand, it can be related to other fundamental quantities. 
Einstein's discoveries showed that due to relativity of motion our space and time can be mathematically combined into one object–spacetime. 
One consequence of this postulate, which follows from the equations of general relativity, is the prediction of moving ripples of spacetime, called gravitational waves. 
The overall shape of space is not known, but space is known to be expanding very rapidly due to the cosmic inflation. 
While some cultures assert the rights of the individual in terms of ownership, other cultures will identify with a communal approach to land ownership. 
Spatial planning is a method of regulating the use of space at land-level, with decisions made at regional, national and international levels. 
Ownership of space is not restricted to land. 
When modeling activity or behavior, it is a conceptual tool used to limit extraneous variables such as terrain. 
Those now concerned with such studies regard it as a distinct branch of psychology. 
The perception of surroundings is important due to its necessary relevance to survival, especially with regards to hunting and self preservation as well as simply one's idea of personal space. 
Although earlier societies had developed measuring systems, the International System of Units, (SI), is now the most common system of units used in the measuring of space, and is almost universally used. 
This definition coupled with present definition of the second is based on the special theory of relativity in which the speed of light plays the role of a fundamental constant of nature. 
In mathematics, a differential equation is an equation that relates one or more unknown functions and their derivatives. 
In applications, the functions generally represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two. 
Such relations are common; therefore, differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including engineering, physics, economics, and biology. 
The order of the differential equation is the highest order of derivative of the unknown function that appears in the differential equation. 
The study of differential equations consists mainly of the study of their solutions (the set of functions that satisfy each equation), and of the properties of their solutions. 
However, many properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without computing them exactly. 
The theory of dynamical systems puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations, while many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy. 
He solves these examples and others using infinite series and discusses the non-uniqueness of solutions. 
This is the problem of determining a curve on which a weighted particle will fall to a fixed point in a fixed amount of time, independent of the starting point. 
Lagrange solved this problem in 1755 and sent the solution to Euler. 
Both further developed Lagrange's method and applied it to mechanics, which led to the formulation of Lagrangian mechanics. 
In classical mechanics, the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time value varies. 
Newton's laws allow these variables to be expressed dynamically (given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body) as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time. 
An example of modeling a real-world problem using differential equations is the determination of the velocity of a ball falling through the air, considering only gravity and air resistance. 
Gravity is considered constant, and air resistance may be modeled as proportional to the ball's velocity. 
This means that the ball's acceleration, which is a derivative of its velocity, depends on the velocity (and the velocity depends on time). 
Finding the velocity as a function of time involves solving a differential equation and verifying its validity. 
Differential equations can be divided into several types. 
Apart from describing the properties of the equation itself, these classes of differential equations can help inform the choice of approach to a solution. 
This list is far from exhaustive; there are many other properties and subclasses of differential equations which can be very useful in specific contexts. 
Such relations are common; therefore, differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including engineering, physics, economics, and biology.

Explaining the reasoning behind the museum's establishment, co-founder Jerry Reilly said in 1995: "While every city in the world has at least one museum dedicated to the best of art, MOBA is the only museum dedicated to collecting and exhibiting the worst." 
Regular showings of the pieces collected by Wilson, Reilly, and Jackson (and those donated by others), became too much for Reilly and Jackson's small home in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, as hundreds of people attended the receptions. 
Although the original gallery was free and open to the public, the second is free with admission to the theater or with a pass requested from the museum. 
The museum offered a reward of $6.50 for the return of Eileen, and although MOBA donors later increased that reward to $36.73, the work remained unrecovered for many years. 
Each painting or sculpture MOBA exhibits is accompanied by a brief description of the medium, size, name of the artist, as well as how the piece was acquired. 
Kate Swoger of The Montreal Gazette called Lucy a "gorgeous mistake", describing her thus: "an elderly woman dancing in a lush spring field, sagging breasts flopping willy-nilly, as she inexplicably seems to hold a red chair to her behind with one hand and a clutch of daisies in the other".
